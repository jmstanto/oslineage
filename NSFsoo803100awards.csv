Yet that system contains a striking variety of lending organizations, ranging from global corporate behemoths to community banks, credit unions and community development institutions, that embrace very different business models missions and values, and that relate to borrowers and communities, including poor and traditionally marginalized minority ones, in very different ways. This project analyzes that organizational variety and its impact in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to determine how differences in lending organizations and the ecologies or mixes of lenders that populate banking markets shape?and might enhance?access to credit for small business in poor and non-white communities. Ideally suited for this study, the PPP was a federal government program that worked though the nations? existing lenders to issue nearly 12 million loans to businesses to keep workers on payroll during the pandemic, and produced detailed data on where and to whom lenders lent.<br/><br/>To address the impact of lender organizational form and bank market ecologies on credit flows, this project combines interviews of lenders and borrowers with multi-level quantitative analyses of a new data set on all PPP loans that links: a) data on lending by seven lender types and socio-economic conditions in 32,000 communities, with b) data on the organizational compositions of 625 regional banking markets that served those communities. These analyses contribute broadly to understanding how organization shapes inequality, while extending organizational ecology and institutional research on organizational form and complexity to new outcomes.  They address a key gap in our knowledge of class and ethno-racial divides in banking and credit, integrating work in organizational studies, economic sociology and political economy on bank organization, banking systems and their economic impacts with research in sociology, law and allied fields, which extensively analyzes banking and credit as sites of discrimination and segregation, but commonly sets organizational variety in banking aside (or focus on large banks) to document broader systemic tendencies.  And by identifying possibilities for greater inclusivity within American banking?and in government programs that work though that system ? this project highlights new avenues for reform, including building the capacities of lenders that engage traditionally marginalized communities and altering mixes of institutions in regional markets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many countries were forced to order shelter-in-place or social distance to slow the spread of the disease forcing organizations to rapidly transition to remote work. While the onset of COVID-19 was disruptive, it has provided a worldwide, if involuntary, quasi experiment. The shift in work was unprecedented in terms of scale (forcing many organizations to operate completely remotely) and scope (affecting organizations across the globe). Individuals were forced to adapt to their new work arrangements, which changed how they go about their day-to-day jobs and other life activities and responsibilities. However, even while we come to terms with the ?new normal,? we have the opportunity - and indeed an obligation - to consider what practices and experiences that emerged as part of the ongoing quasi experiment we may want to retain, by virtue of their efficacy, as we transition out of COVID-19. In other words, what can we learn from our experiences in the ?new normal? that will help shape the ?next normal? as we transition out of COVID-19?  To answer this question, this project will use survey and server-side data collected as workers team together using digital technologies at different points through the pandemic. <br/>This project is rooted in a ?teaming affordances? perspective. The sudden shift to all-virtual meetings, and use of digital communication technologies, has heightened workers? awareness of the affordances provided by technologies, for example, to be kept updated on what their colleagues are doing (visibility affordance) or what they know and the nature of their relationships with one another (association affordance). Technology affordances serve as the foundation for teamwork, enabling essential behaviors such as boundary spanning, leading collectively, and motivating. We investigate the extent to which a heightened awareness of the affordances provided by digital collaboration technologies has the ability to nudge workers to engage in teaming behaviors that lead to better team outcomes. Insights from this investigation will make it possible to identify and isolate practices that were triggered by the sudden shift to remote work during COVID-19, but which we must consider retaining as we transition out of COVID-19 and workers have the ability to physically return to the workplace. This project leverages teaming data collected by the project team during and prior to COVID-19, expanding these sources to include a new wave of data collection once in-person work is again possible (?The Next Normal?). Additionally, the project will complement longitudinal field surveys with semi-structured interviews and two waves of a general survey of workers. The project will apply a range of advanced network analytics, including exponential random graph models (ERGMs) and relational event modeling (REM). The interview data will be analyzed using grounded theory methodologies in order to identify practices that help and hinder teaming. This mixed-method longitudinal design makes it possible to explore research questions and test hypotheses about virtual teaming that advance fundamental knowledge on what we can learn from this forced quasi experiment on virtual teaming in a crisis that should inform better teaming practices and outcomes as we transition out of the pandemic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One prominent example is the adoption and deployment of body-worn cameras by law enforcement organizations. Body worn cameras are small video and audio recording devices that law enforcement officers wear when in the field and when interacting with the public. Body-worn cameras have a variety of technological features that can potentially transform officer training, accountability, and performance, and increase or decrease community trust in law enforcement. However, previous findings on the effects of body-worn cameras on individuals and organizations have varied widely. The goal of this project is to better understand how individual, organizational, environmental, and technological factors interact to influence how officers and the communities they serve respond to body-worn cameras.    <br/><br/>The project collects data from multiple sources to answer research questions about the effects of body-worn cameras. In the first phase of data collection, the project team collects survey data from patrol officers working in nearly 60 agencies that use body-worn cameras. The surveys include measures of burnout, well-being, proactivity, and attitudes regarding their organizations and body-worn cameras. The project team also conducts interviews with high-ranking officers from each of these agencies to better understand body-worn camera implementation in each agency. In the second phase of data collection, community members from each of the jurisdictions that the participating law enforcement agencies serve are surveyed regarding their attitudes about their local agency and about law enforcement technologies. Community sentiments are triangulated using by colling data from social media posts using natural language processing techniques. These multi-level multi-source data allow the project team to test a model of the effects of body-worn cameras on officers and communities and create fundamental knowledge about the ways organizations operate in modern digital contexts, building critical theoretical groundwork to inform future design and policy of body-worn camera use in law enforcement organizations. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Science of Organizations Program (SoO) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, gender disparities continue to exist in academic science around the world, both in the quantity and in the impact of research output. In the decade after 2000, male researchers, on average, published 35% more papers and received 34% more citations than female researchers. These gender gaps are even wider in the United States than the global average. Understanding causes of persistent gender gaps in research is of grave significance for improving gender equality in academic institutions. The current project is an interdisciplinary effort to address this question and advance knowledge across multiple fields, including psychology, sociology, organizational behavior, human resource management, and scientometrics. It will propose a novel theory that integrates existing perspectives and test it using a big data approach.<br/><br/>Specifically, the project investigates topic fit (i.e., the degree of subject topic similarity or congruence between any new collaboration and a researcher?s existing work) as a key mechanism for understanding gender gaps in research productivity and impact. Drawing upon Social Role Theory, it is theorized that gender role norms and expectations may lead female and male scholars to have different collaboration patterns with junior researchers and lower levels of topic fit for women, which, in turn, would explain a productivity penalty for women. The investigators are analyzing publication records of over 90 million researchers around the world, computing topic fit indices using novel methods, and testing these indices as a critical mechanism for explaining gender gaps using both path analysis at the individual researcher level and multilevel modeling to account for the nested structure of the data. Importantly, the project also examines differences across academic disciplines and analyzes trends over time. Findings can inform institutional policies and practices for advancing gender equality in academic science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

If the disruption is minor, like a flat tire, recovery is easy. If the disruption is major, recovery may be more difficult. For example, the shutdowns caused by the COVID pandemic forced doctors, nurses, and other clinical staff to find new ways to care for their patients.  This research will  use this example to study the effects of disruptions on healthcare routines. The expectation is that routines will ?bounce back? from minor disruptions, but the effects of major disruptions are more difficult to predict. After major disruptions, some routines may return to normal, while others may not.   <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to discover basic mechanisms that influence stability and change in routines.  To understand what makes some routines stronger than others, the effects of the COVID pandemic will be studied in four medical fields at the University of Rochester Medical Center: dermatology, orthopedics, oncology, and cardiology.  Data from electronic health records will be used to study the effects of shutdowns and other kinds of disruptions, such as changes in software and billing codes. Tools from network science will be used to model routines as patterns of action. These methods will allow comparisons to be made between patterns of action before and after a disruption with great precision. The extent to which the strength of a routine depends on the structure of the action pattern itself will be examined.  Data will be produced on outpatient clinical routines during the COVID-19 pandemic along with  a variety of materials to communicate the findings with a broader audience. Ultimately, this research will lead to a better understanding of how institutional routines can be made more reliable and effective in the face of disasters large and small.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While recovery efforts are initially aided by large amounts of government and private contributions, appropriate assessment requires consideration of a range of variables that might influence the pace of recovery. This project explores what happens once the media attention has ebbed and aid organizations begin to leave the area. Do these disasters and the recovery efforts result in long-term sociocultural changes, and what are the implications for those changes on development and economic revitalization of these areas? As a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award, the project integrates research and training to more effectively reinforce the infrastructure necessary to conduct effective scientific research. Funds would support graduate students with scientific and methodological training, field experience, and support in completing their theses. Widely-disseminated results will help inform future humanitarian policy and practice, and would forge international scientific cooperation in area of disaster recovery. <br/><br/>Mark Schiller of Northern Illinois University explores the question of what long term changes to local socio-cultural institutions remain following the end of an aid or development project. Haiti's 2010 earthquake was one of the world's deadliest disasters in recent memory. It also inspired one of the most generous international humanitarian responses ever attempted. Despite the continuing global recession, governments pledged over $10 billion and private citizens contributed over $3 billion. The proposed research will offer methodological insights into ethnographic evaluation of INGOs (international non-governmental organizations) in disaster recovery efforts. The proposed five-year research project uses a purposive sample of eight rural communities with differing presence of humanitarian and development INGOs before and after the earthquake. While the researcher conducts interviews with donor, state, and organizational representatives, a team of graduate students shares responsibilities for participant observation and interview methods on social indicators, including level of dependence, independent mobilization, spatial organization, and what the researcher has termed ""civic infrastructure,"" noting evolution over time. The educational component includes a research methods seminar in Haiti and a two-week Field School training, held concurrently with an NGO Summer Institute at Northern Illinois University."

However, many researchers have noted that they largely fail to represent the reasons certain actions are judged to be effective in organizational settings than others, or why respondents selected less effective actions. This project will focus on evaluating how elaborated situational judgment tests (ESJTs) ? whereby respondents additionally rate the expected effects of responding in different ways to SJT scenarios ? can address this limitation.  Past work has detailed that ESJTs provide avenues for representing a person?s reasons for selecting different responses to job-relevant situations in the form of graphical causal models.  This project will explore how ESJTs can be used to (a) represent how diverse populations (e.g., individuals of different age groups, genders, or ethnicities) understand particular workplace scenarios, (b) represent the role of situational factors in altering the effectiveness of specific organizational behaviors, and (c) provide opportunities for teaching more effective organizational behavior. By bringing these processes to light, EJSTs can be used to not only improve the validity of personnel selection systems and inform more effective workplace training procedures, but also to advance efforts to create a fairer and more inclusive work environment.<br/><br/>In Project 1, ratings of the expected effects of different responses to organizational situations within a validated SJT will be collected from both working adults and subject matter experts.  These ratings will be used to create new indices of the degree to which employees show an expert?s understanding of the effectiveness of different responses to job situations. These indices will be explored for their ability to predict organizational outcomes such as job performance and satisfaction beyond other valid predictors. In Project 2, a novel set of scenarios will be developed to detail how specific contextual factors (e.g., deadlines, relative organizational rank) alter the reasons for preferring one response to job-relevant situations over others.  In Project 3, ESJT-based instruments will be explored as pedagogical tools that can supplement case studies in MBA and other professional programs for teaching effective decision-making, and for detailing how populations with different backgrounds and levels of experience come to perceive and process organizational situations differently. These can then be used to provide more concrete points for discussing how diverse groups come to understand ?the same? organizational situations differently, and for teaching employees about the factors that make different responses to organizational situations more or less effective. The project will generate publicly available tools for creating and modeling data from elaborated situational judgment tasks, and for utilizing them effectively in both selection and job training contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of these power dynamics, supervisors who are hostile toward their employees elicit strong negative reactions that ultimately harm employees and cost U.S. organizations billions of dollars in reduced productivity. To date, researchers have focused only on the short-term consequences of supervisor hostility and have neglected to consider the idea that psychological trauma that often comes along with interpersonal mistreatment can remain with its victims for years into the future. Studying this phenomenon over a longer time horizon also raises the possibility that some employees ultimately grow from this experience, just as some trauma victims experience growth after great devastation. This project explores the cognitive, emotional, physiological, and behavioral differences exhibited by employees who have been the target of supervisor hostility in the past. Project results may provide guidance to practitioners interested in helping abused employees recover from long-term harm. Further, by demonstrating that an organization that bears no direct responsibility for the original abuse nonetheless bears some of the costs, we hope to inspire a collective sense of responsibility for changing the cultures, climates, and structures of work that enable supervisor hostility. Moreover, based on the idea that minorities and those without structural power are often targeted by hostile supervisors, we hope that our research will contribute to its reduction and ultimately help level the playing field in terms of minority employment opportunities. Finally, our research may contribute to public policy regarding the type of work environments desired and tolerated by society. We hope the results will contribute to conversations that change management practice for the benefit of employees? well-being.<br/><br/>Using a multi-method approach, employing surveys (both self- and other-reports), a battery of laboratory tasks (e.g., Taylor Aggression Paradigm, trust games, emotional Stroop), physiological measures, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks, we test our ideas and overall conceptual model with matched samples of 100 employees who have been exposed to supervisor hostility in the past and 100 employees who have not. The project aims to contribute to research by: (1) providing a model of the long-term consequences of supervisor hostility, grounded in social psychology, human cognition, and neuroscience theory and research, (2) extending research on supervisor hostility from the short-term to the long-term, providing an important first examination of the phenomenon and fostering multiple avenues for future research on this topic, and (3) illuminating potential positive consequences of supervisor hostility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Diverse teams are essential in organizations since they enable individuals to transcend the limits of their specialization, integrate diverse viewpoints, generate innovative ideas, and solve wicked problems. Although organizations have promoted heterogeneity in their units for decades, several workers are less likely to engage with teams when forced to work together. And despite the expanded training in organizations, workers? attitudes and behaviors toward individual difference are hard to change.

This project aims to create an open-source computational network model to optimize team formation by integrating functional individual difference and member affinity. The researchers train and test this computational model using empirical data from four distinct teaming contexts: scientific collaborations, open-source software development, space crews simulating long-duration space exploration missions, and project teams among students in educational and executive development programs. Utilizing the Multitheoretical Multilevel (MTML) framework, the researchers explore how teams within social networks can form at various levels (individual, dyad, triad, and group) and seek to maximize heterogeneity in certain characteristics while enhancing members? affinity in others. Key goals include developing an MTML model to elucidate team assembly mechanisms, implementing a data-driven computational model to estimate team performance and viability based on member and network attributes, conducting virtual experiments to explore the impacts of various team configurations, and publishing an interactive web-based exploratorium for users to simulate team performance and viability dynamically.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

First, how does ICT use shape employee engagement in innovation process, and in turn influence individual-level emergent states and outcomes? Second, how does ICT use interact with formal communication structure to shape intra- and inter-team dynamics in communication and knowledge creation, and to impact team-level emergent states and outcomes? Third, how does organizational climate for innovation shape the influence of ICT use on organizational innovation processes and outcomes? This project contributes to the literature by providing a theoretical model that explicates the influence of ICT use on individual and team innovation processes, extending the stream of literature on organizational learning by clarifying the most significant dynamic process, examining how organizational climate for innovation influences the effects of ICT use on innovation, and providing a clearly specified and rigorous mathematical model that facilitates future extension and integration with other theoretical models of learning and innovation. The project takes a multi-method approach, including computational modeling, laboratory experiments, archival data analysis, and a field study."

Healthcare providers need a diverse range of information in order to protect themselves and the public. However, they may, or may not, be able to obtain such information from their employers. In critical and time sensitive situations, they may obtain information from other sources to complement employer-provided information. This research aims to study the dynamics on the types of  information healthcare providers wanted and obtained and their relationships with organizational network and structural characteristics. <br/><br/>This research is grounded in the literature on social network and organizational structure. It also builds on the principal investigators' previous productive collaboration on the health information wants (HIW) concept, framework, and questionnaire, which emphasizes a bottom-up approach to understanding the types and amount of a broad range of health information wanted by individuals. This study can advance knowledge about social network and organizational structure by examining their effects on healthcare providers in various healthcare organizations in time sensitive situations like the current Ebola crisis. It can also advance the HIW framework by examining its use in the context of healthcare organizations. It bridges together these two previously separated bodies of literature and creates new knowledge about the information healthcare providers wanted and obtained, as well as their relationships with social network and organizational structure. Study findings can help develop informational, educational interventions to effectively and efficiently provide the right types and amount of information healthcare providers in different organizations want in Ebola-like emergencies in the future. The findings may lead to improved health and well-being of healthcare providers and the patients they care for when similar crises occur."

There is a critical need to understand how to increase honest and effective public administration within low-income, difficult environments because it is in the national interest for financial commitments to be effective and strategic.  Public sector organizational effectiveness is a critical foundation for other efforts to improve human wellbeing, whether providing education, improving public health, broadening opportunities, or stimulating economic growth.  This project will seek to explain observed differences in performance from efforts to replicate fully a commercial court model in six regions and distinct efforts to spread Alternative Dispute Resolution to courts throughout all regions.  The project advances the fields of organizational scholarship and macrosociological scholarship by analyzing how social factors influence the ability to identify and successfully adopt practices that may enhance organizational effectiveness.  The educational objective of the project is to foster a new subfield of scholars focused on explaining variation in organizational effectiveness within public sectors.<br/><br/>The research approach is a mixed methods analysis evaluating five theoretically informed hypotheses. Study 1 assesses the hypotheses through qualitative comparative case analysis of six newly created regional commercial courts, drawing on ethnographic observation and interviews with judges and staff. Study 2 examines the spread of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) to courts, constructing and analyzing a detailed quantitative dataset by surveying the population of judges eligible to conduct ADR (n=333), collecting information on demographics, prior professional experience, experience with ADR, and professional networks. These distinct but related studies will advance understanding of variation in organizational strength within and between organizational systems.  The work also contributes to establishing the social foundations of organizational effectiveness, thereby contributing to ongoing multidisciplinary debates on why we observe persistent differences in organizational performance in both public and private sectors. The proposed work brings crucial sociological variables into the analysis of how particular features of social context and individual interpretation influence adaption outcomes, for example analyzing how new practices that are technically capable of improving effectiveness intersect with social foundations that shape whether those new practices can be effectively implemented. The research products will be integrated into undergraduate teaching on social science methods.  The research also will be integrated into graduate-level training workshops to help foster a broader research community around the topic of socio-organizational approaches to understanding effective public sector organizations.<br/>?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this study, the investigator conceptualizes AI innovation as a dynamic emergent outcome of ongoing and dynamic interactions among constituent technological components independently designed and developed by heterogeneous actors in the AI innovation ecology. By doing so, the investigator explores how the meaning of AI innovation evolves as the boundary of AI's innovation ecology continues to shift and expand. Through a comprehensive historical analysis of contemporary AI innovation, the project helps us understand exactly how AI has evolved and will likely evolve in the future. The project identifies potential weak links in the AI innovation ecology for continuing development of AI innovation to direct future investments and research efforts.<br/><br/>The investigator is using a multi-method with two distinct but interrelated research activities. First, the investigator is conducting a qualitative analysis of the AI innovation's emergent evolution, leveraging archival data about the development of current AI innovation from news articles on AI, related enabling technology components, and its applications.  Second, the investigator is conducting computational analyses to understand how to understand the generative diffusion of AI innovations over time through different fields by analyzing (a) publicly available documents, including mainstream news, academic research publications, and (b) open-source projects in GitHub platform that use open-source AI frameworks.

This research will apply big data mining techniques, and social network and statistical analyses of Twitter data to identify personal factors that predict job loss, over and above a company's business and economic conditions. This topic is important for management and organization science disciplines because most of what we know about job loss is at the society and company level (such as plant closings). The project will lead to a better understanding of how the changing nature of work is affecting people.<br/><br/>The researchers are taking a hybrid big data theory-based approach, using information derived from the popular social media Twitter. Two studies are devised: (1) Identify job loss predictors from micro, meso and macro perspectives in Twitter data by exploiting linguistic and sentiment analysis; (2) Analyze the job topic networks of Twitter users to infer network indices as predictors of job loss. The sets of predictors identified in studies (1) and (2) will be used independently and together as input to a cascade of inference models that will gauge the amount of variance in job loss explained by each of the information domains. This project will extend fundamental methodological knowledge by demonstrating how big data mining might be used in conjunction with statistical analysis to identify multiple predictors of job loss from the content of tweets and social media networks."

Diverse teams are essential in organizations since they enable individuals to transcend the limits of their specialization, integrate diverse viewpoints, generate innovative ideas, and solve wicked problems. Although organizations have promoted heterogeneity in their units for decades, several workers are less likely to engage with teams when forced to work together. And despite the expanded training in organizations, workers? attitudes and behaviors toward individual difference are hard to change.

In doing so, this research provides innovative solutions to optimize team performance and viability. <br/><br/>The ""Collaborative Research: HNDS-R: Advancing Diverse Viable Effective Networked Teams (ADVENT)"" project addresses the challenge of forming high-performance, high-viability teams with significant heterogeneity and affinity levels. This project aims to create an open-source computational network model to optimize team formation by integrating functional individual difference and member affinity. The researchers train and test this computational model using empirical data from four distinct teaming contexts: scientific collaborations, open-source software development, space crews simulating long-duration space exploration missions, and project teams among students in educational and executive development programs. Utilizing the Multitheoretical Multilevel (MTML) framework, the researchers explore how teams within social networks can form at various levels (individual, dyad, triad, and group) and seek to maximize heterogeneity in certain characteristics while enhancing members? affinity in others. Key goals include developing an MTML model to elucidate team assembly mechanisms, implementing a data-driven computational model to estimate team performance and viability based on member and network attributes, conducting virtual experiments to explore the impacts of various team configurations, and publishing an interactive web-based exploratorium for users to simulate team performance and viability dynamically.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In a future of work rife with uncertainty, there will be an increasing demand for employees who are willing to take risks for the benefit of their organization and its members. Risk taking, however, plays a double-edged role in organizational settings. Multiple corporate catastrophes, such as the financial crisis of 2008 and the Enron scandal, can be traced to reckless and unethical risky behaviors of bankers, investors, and accountants. Indeed, risk takers can be both assets and liabilities for their organization and the society. This project examines the impact of risk taking in work settings and explores how organizations can best identify and manage risk takers to leverage their appetite for risks toward achieving organizational and societal goals.<br/><br/>Despite the significance of risk taking in organizational life, there is little research on how to best select, place, and manage risk takers at work to maximize organizational effectiveness. Research to date has primarily focused on the risk taking of executives, while less is known about how employee risk taking affects organizational outcomes. This project integrates economic, evolutionary, and psychological theories of risk to 1) examine the role of dispositional risk taking (i.e., risk propensity) on employee performance through longitudinal and multi-source survey studies; 2) understand the within-person dynamics of employee risk taking behaviors using daily-diary methods; and 3) develop a contextualized measure of workplace risk taking using a situational judgment test. Besides understanding who takes risks at work, the project also sheds light on employee behaviors through the lens of risk perceptions. Finally, this project develops a multi-disciplinary educational curriculum aimed at management, psychology, and human resource development students. Results from this project will advance the science of risk taking at work while providing industry and the public with a valid assessment of workplace employee risk taking.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These activities are recorded in the form of administrative expenditures and other organizational archives that have the potential to advance understanding of how the organization of academic research labs relates to scientific productivity, innovation, and impact. This project uses expenditure and research records to better understand how data that are localized and readily available to universities can be used to study academic research labs and develop improved metrics for benchmarking, policy development, and communication to public constituents.   <br/><br/>This project applies theories of organizational formation and performance to academic research labs and uses a multi-level research design at the individual, lab, and university levels to investigate the organizational character of scientific productivity in three interrelated stages. First, this project combines large-scale administrative archives with machine learning and inferential statistics to develop a novel computational approach for characterizing the organizational models that underlie the operation of academic research labs. In this step, the project demonstrates a strategy and means of leveraging administrative records to construct theory-driven and empirically instantiated organizational models expressed across a variety of academic research labs. Second, this project extends its focus to the longitudinal operation of academic research labs to examine the extent to which lab models persist or change over time and evaluate whether and how academic research labs differ from organizations in the private sector.

However, as evidenced by recent events (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic), Asian Americans and Asians in the U.S. face biases from lacking leadership opportunities, receiving little social acceptance and support, to experiencing racialized verbal and physical attacks. These biases occur even in places where Asians are well-represented such as STEM schools and workplaces. Past theory and research have documented several stereotypes that explain why biases against Asians can occur (e.g., being seen as foreign and high achieving). The current project expands on past work by exploring a unique contributor to biases against Asians based on interdisciplinary research on dehumanization. Specifically, it is proposed that Asians have historically been viewed in the U.S. as like machines or robotics, indicating that they are subject to ?mechanistic dehumanization.? Integrating this dehumanization perspective with social and industrial-organizational psychology research, this project develops a theoretical model to explain how Asians in the U.S. are impacted by mechanistic dehumanization. It also documents the psychological processes that can contribute to potential interventions to encourage people to see the humanity in others.<br/><br/>This project is organized around a set of qualitative (e.g., focus groups) and quantitative (e.g., surveys, experiments) studies to examine the causes, consequences, and countermeasures of mechanistic dehumanization of Asians in the context of STEM workplaces and educational settings. Asian communities in the U.S. are diverse, and this project focuses on East Asian, South Asian, and Southeast Asian (i.e., the major Asian subgroups in the U.S.) targets while including members of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds as participants. The project unpacks key subfactors of mechanistic dehumanization, such as perceived submissiveness and lack of emotions, and it develops an instrument to scientifically assess this concept. Using this measure, the project will systematically explore three objectives. First, it determines the extent to which mechanistic dehumanization can explain biases against Asians (e.g., lack of social support at school and at work). Second, it exposes the psychological processes explaining why mechanistic dehumanization may underlie these biases. Third, it uncovers causes (e.g., group and cultural differences) that make Asians in the U.S. more vulnerable to mechanistic dehumanization. The project also develops anti-dehumanization educational materials to increase awareness of these issues and to improve equity and inclusion in social, educational, and organizational contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the need for social distancing, the ability to continue essential business functions through effective remote work arrangements is a key means for addressing the global health crisis. However, many organizations are unprepared to accommodate a remote workforce and likewise lack insight into best practices as to how to promote continued productivity and well-being of the workforce in such arrangements. Although there is a large body of extant research on remote work arrangements, numerous questions remained under investigated. This project will address these gaps by studying the impact of several organizational, individual, technological, and supervisor characteristics on remote worker adjustment, well-being, and productivity. Findings from the project will provide evidence-based best practices that many large and small businesses can use both during future pandemics and other extreme events, but also going forward in normal work environments that may increasingly want to support remote work.<br/><br/>The COVID-19 pandemic has suddenly promoted the need for remote work arrangements on a vast scale, but we lack key information regarding what makes such work productive and sustainable. This project will obtain data from 500 full-time employees who are working remotely during the response to COVID-19 but were not doing so previously. The first phase of the project will collect a baseline survey that captures characteristics and experiences prior to the pandemic and remote work transition and general perceptions of the adjustment to remote work process. Phase 2 involves a 30-day experience sampling study administered daily at the end of each workday that will capture day-to-day experiences, attitudes, and performance of remote workers. Benefits of this panel design are: 1) provides insights into how multiple dynamic changes influence outcomes; 2) enhances ecological validity; 3) allows researchers to examine both within- and between-person processes; and 4) reduces retrospective recall biases.

This trend has fueled 24-7 ""always-on"" work cultures, contributing to blurring work-life boundaries, defined as the separation between work and personal life domains.  Work-life boundaries may be more permeable for women, and any worker with family demands, causing work-nonwork stress and lower well-being.  Yet the issue of work-life boundaries  is not well understood as a gender career equality and inclusion issue, which may be limiting the representation of women in male-imbalanced  STEM disciplines. This project bridges the work-life, diversity, and gender fields to advance knowledge on how work-life inclusive climates and practices influence women faculty's career well-being.  The project defines a work-life inclusive climate as the degree that people perceive that they entirely belong and thrive while incorporating work and nonwork roles in ways that do not sacrifice their nonwork identities while performing their jobs. The project will help to frame workplace policies promoting effective boundary management in not only universities and STEM/non-STEM disciplines, but workplaces across U.

Structural characteristics of jobs such as social support, decision-making autonomy, and perceived significance are positively associated with outcomes such as job satisfaction and retention. However, effects of characteristics of jobs vary across gender, even when males and females occupy the same position. Differences are also evident in time allocation on faculty jobs: males spend more time engaged in research than females, who put more time into mentoring and service. Gendered patterns are especially pronounced among STEM faculty. While such differences have been well documented, we have little understanding why the work experiences of male and female faculty diverge. The proposed project uses work design theory as a lens for investigating the variability in work experiences and job outcomes across male and female STEM faculty, providing new insight into structural barriers that help and hinder underrepresented groups in STEM careers. The plan of work includes a three-wave longitudinal panel design survey, a 10-day daily experience sampling method study, a series of focus group interviews, and an archival review of promotion and tenure files. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>Lack of female role models discourages female participation in STEM careers; thus, increasing the number of female faculty in male dominated STEM fields is key to broadening participation of women in STEM. Findings from the theoretically derived proposed set of relationships will elucidate the complex interplay between top down and bottom up processes within organizations that contribute to alignment between individual and organizational goals and that can lead to the design of effective programs and interventions within organizations. Expected outcomes include a more nuanced understanding of the daily work experiences of female STEM faculty and how those experiences differ from their male counterparts. It is also expected that the findings will reveal micro level processes that inhibit the successful progression and retention of female faculty. This proposed research unites diverse expertise across several fields of science in effort to apply a multidisciplinary perspective to the research questions. The findings will be used to help inform and stimulate ways in which organizations can alter work design processes, in an effort to advance the careers of women in STEM. Funding will be used to support a doctoral student researcher. The doctoral student will gain research project management experience and be involved in products associated with the research (e.g., conference presentations; publications). The proposed project will also provide research experiences for undergraduates who will be supervised by the doctoral research assistant. Such experiences contribute to the development of a scientifically literate workforce in that undergraduates who participate in research have reported cognitive gains such as increased confidence in their ability to do science and learning to ""think and work like a scientist."" Developmental activities and experiences will include lab meeting and departmental presentations, scholarly article discussions, and written developmental plans."

This project extends our prior work on emergent phenomena in teams by applying computational modeling to an extended network of MTSs. The goal is to design a highly flexible computational agent architecture that can be applied to a broad range of team types (e.g., action, project, decision-making teams), task structures (e.g., pooled, sequential, reciprocal, intensive), and MTS contexts (e.g., military, medical, business). The computational model will be used to conduct virtual experiments to evaluate the effects of different team composition and leadership configurations on team (Phase 1) and MTS (Phase 2) effectiveness, and the resilience and adaptability potential of different configurations given internal and external shocks (Phase 3). This modeling research has many practical applications. In particular, it is designed to identify the basic mechanisms that underpin team effectiveness.  The model can then be used to predict the effectiveness of particular team and MTS configurations and, based on those findings, provide prescriptive principles for composing teams, and appointing team leaders, to ensure that teams and systems of teams are optimized for effectiveness. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>The emergence and dynamics of phenomena relevant to the effectiveness of team and MTSs has proven difficult using the dominant research methods (experimental and correlational research) employed in organizational psychology and behavior (OPB). A ""third discipline"" based on computational modeling is needed if OPB is to advance understanding of process dynamics. The development of a comprehensive computational model, based on a Markov Decision Process (MDP) architecture, which incorporates team composition, leadership structure, and process mechanisms within- and between-teams, will mark a significant advance in OPB.  A key advantage of computational simulation is the ability to systematically and thoroughly map a theoretical space.  Virtual experimentation will enable specification of the fundamental mechanisms that drive dynamic interconnections among leadership, team structures, and member composition ad their sensitivity, resilience, and adaptability to internal and external shocks. Moreover, our use of the MDP ""engine"" will enable specification of optimality and deviations from it. Research findings will enable subsequent empirical research to be more precisely targeted, with specific points for intervention identified.  The formal computational model will enable the generation of generalizable predictive forecasts of the effectiveness of various team and MTS leadership structures under different within- and between-team conditions. Thus, recommendations from this research are intended to enhance the gains of subsequent empirical research in terms of both efficiency (i.e., focusing on promising targets, avoiding research that is less likely to be productive) and effectiveness (i.e., focusing on interventions that are more likely to be successful). This is vitally important because research on teams and MTSs is highly resource intensive. By more precisely targeting at human research based on the findings of virtual experiments, the resources invested in human research are likely to have a much higher return. Thus, this research has the potential to aid funding agencies to more precisely target research funding priorities.  Moreover, the research has a wide range of potential applications.  This same flexibility permits examination and quantification of how adaptive and responsive different system configurations would be to unexpected shocks.  As a result, decision-makers would have the predictive and prescriptive tools from which to make informed decisions about critical personnel, team structure, and organizational design decisions."

Yet women remain underrepresented in many STEM fields, which has dramatic, negative consequences both for equality and for creativity and innovation, which often benefit from diverse perspectives. This award develops knowledge that increases women?s representation in STEM fields, focusing on information technology (IT). The research is organized around two projects. Project 1 examines the characteristics of IT jobs, as described in job advertisements, that increase women?s likelihood of applying. Project 2 examines whether legislation requiring medium-term, employer-paid maternity leave changes women?s likelihood of applying to jobs and companies? likelihood of interviewing them. The findings inform companies regarding the job descriptions that attract female applicants and policymakers regarding the design of parental-leave policies. <br/><br/>This award includes two projects aimed at promoting women?s representation in STEM fields. It uses large scale data from an e-recruiting platform?including ~6 million applications to ~20,000 IT job advertisements posted by ~13,000 companies?that allows tracking of women?s progress through the hiring funnel. Project 1 identifies characteristics of job advertisements that increase the likelihood of women applying, using natural language processing and machine learning. Findings from this project expand the literature on women?s workforce participation, specifically regarding the job descriptions that appeal to women. Since prior work uses a deductive approach, it has necessarily considered only a small set of potentially relevant characteristics. This award instead uses an inductive approach to build theory, leveraging ?big? data to uncover relationships that are hard to hypothesize a priori. Project 2 uses an event study to examine the effects of legislation mandating medium-term employer-paid maternity leave. Findings from this project expand the literature on women?s workforce participation, specifically regarding policy interventions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the movement into highspeed. The future of work includes a substantial number of workers who will work from home. Moreover, organizations continue to grapple with how to meet business demands while also accommodating employees who wish to work remotely. These changes have prompted the need to better understand fully remote and hybrid (i.e., some days in the office and some days from home) work modes and the needs of those who work from home. As such, the project team is analyzing existing daily time use data as well as collecting additional data intended to shine a light on how the location of work alters daily activities (e.g., exercise, sleep), transitions (e.g., switching from work to nonwork roles), and overall employee wellbeing.  The findings will be used to provide actionable insights to managers and inform the development of interventions to support remote workers.<br/>   <br/>The project?s objective is to reveal a better understanding of the day-to-day experiences associated with hybrid work and how those experiences differ from work done away from home. The project involves two studies. Study 1 is a time use study based on data from the American Time Use Study that enables the research team to examine time use (activity and location) sequence patterns and transitions in 15-minute increments across the course of a 24-hr period.

Thus, there is a critical need to identify pathways through which employees can achieve work effectiveness and wellbeing, despite facing difficulties. Work resilience -- positive adaptation despite adversity at work -- is an advantageous tool that offers a path to success despite adverse experiences. We propose one unexplored way to increase resilience is through recovery, in which non-work time is used to recuperate from fatigue and negative mood built up during the work day. This project's goal is to understand how psychological (e.g., detachment from work, relaxation) and physical (e.g., sleep, exercise) recovery experiences relate to work resilience. Determining behaviors that improve resilience which are under individuals' control during their non-work time has the potential to benefit individuals, teams, and organizations across every occupation. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to uncover and model the dynamic interrelationship of psychological and physical work recovery experiences with work resilience. This project: 1) assesses potential psychological (fatigue) and physiological (heart rate variability) mechanisms that link work recovery and resilience; 2) examines the differential effects of alternative work recovery experiences (i.e., psychological and physical) on work resilience; and 3) delineates the temporal dynamics between work recovery and resilience, uncovering potential cumulative and reciprocal effects. We will conduct two experience sampling research studies using (a) a sample of traditionally employed participants who work during standard weekly business hours and (b) a sample of shift workers - employees who work alternative shifts that at least partially fall outside the daytime shift range (e.g., night shift and rotating shift employees) - to test the current model. Each study is a four-week daily survey study in a sample of 100 working adults that incorporates both objective behavioral and physiological indicators. By explicating the relative importance of different recovery experiences contributing to work resilience and the dynamic relationship between work recovery and resilience, this project could provide a theoretical foundation to enhance organizational effectiveness and employee wellbeing despite unavoidable adversities. Findings will be shared with research outlets, business practitioners, policy makers, and community members.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Several states have instituted requirements that the boards of public companies become more diverse in terms gender, race, and sexual orientation or provide evidence of the company?s broader commitment to developing and maintaining board diversity. Yet, while researchers have explored the performance impacts of board demographic composition, the findings remain equivocal given little attention to the mechanisms through which such relationships occur. This project endeavors to fill this gap within the diversity and strategy literatures to advance insight into the value of and for diversity in corporate governance. With a central hypothesis that board demographic diversity impacts organizational performance through experience-based diversity, this project will examine the effects of director demographic and experienced-based characteristics on organizational strategic actions and financial performance. <br/><br/>The project will utilize data on director and board characteristics across approximately 1,500 publicly traded firms in the U.S. over a ten-year period from 2007-2017. These data along with data on firm governance quality, strategic choices and firm performance will be obtained from several databases, including BoardEx, CompuStat, the Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS),<br/>RavenPack News Analytics, and Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI). Director data will be aggregated and combined with firm-level data to estimate the effects of board diversity variables on firm organizational actions and performance. Overall, this project offers an integrative, process-based perspective for understanding value creation and capture as it pertains to board diversity. By encouraging and establishing a future research agenda for a more systemic approach to the study of board diversity and firm performance, this project has the potential for enhancing the explanatory power and practical usefulness of future firm-level diversity research.

To test this theory, we develop a web-based application that allows internet users to complete automated virtual job interviews and receive algorithmic feedback or human feedback on their performance. In doing so, we improve scientific understanding of how people respond to algorithmic feedback while simultaneously providing people with authentic feedback on their interview performance, a societal benefit.  <br/><br/>In this project, organizational trust theory, which specifies a theoretical structure for trust and likely consequences, has been integrated into feedback intervention theory, which describes the process by which people act upon received feedback, to better predict behavioral change in response to algorithmic feedback.

To overcome these challenges, this project leverages natural language processing (NLP) to build the most comprehensive, publicly accessible biodata repository. Paired with a linked work analysis, the repository houses thousands of items across dozens of constructs, including their psychometric properties. This project, therefore, helps democratize biodata and empower users to create tailored biodata scales within organizations, as well as provide rigorous tests of the efficacy of different types of biodata inventories. Moreover, this project will explore biodata?s potential for reducing adverse impact and test bias, addressing a concern in personnel selection.<br/><br/>This project begins by crafting prototypical items to assess dozens of work-related constructs.

Empirical, rational, and hybrid scoring keys are being developed, and a job analysis tool as well to help users identify optimal biodata content and to estimate validity based on the job analysis. Finally, all content are examined for potential group differences to determine susceptibility to adverse impact or statistical test bias.

Compassionate communication involves noticing the need for compassion and the details of patients? lives, connecting emotionally and cognitively though empathy and perspective-talking, and responding with effective (non)verbal strategies. AITs can inhibit (non)verbal communication with patients, and although AITs enable more online interaction, establishing compassion within these venues can be taxing.  This project examines how health care workers innovate their communication practices following AIT implementation to practice compassionate communication and patient perceptions on best provider practices.  Because compassion is especially important when serving vulnerable populations, this project studies compassionate AIT use in (a) a federally qualified health center providing care to a poverty-stricken population (b) a high-tech hospital serving higher income patients. <br/><br/>This project addresses the problem technology poses for compassionate health care communication by interviewing and observing providers and surveying patients to understand their perspectives on how new AITs both constrain and afford patient-provider communication and relationship-building. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews will allow providers to reflect on and explain their AIT behaviors, and video observation tools will expose providers? AIT behaviors and patients? responses. The researcher will complete 100 video observational hours at two health care organizational sites, 100 hours observing current in-person communication workshops at these sites, 60 provider interviews, and 300 patient surveys.

This overwork culture stems from the expectation that ideal workers should put work before family and demonstrate unlimited and undivided commitment to work. This norm may be especially problematic for American women, whose time availability is more likely to be limited by caregiving responsibilities. This study investigates this ideal worker norm, and the conditions under which the norm might change.  The project studies organizational policies that allow time off and flexibility in work schedules and locations, as well as conditions under which these policies are implemented.  It also investigates female managerial representation in the organization, which may be important for organizational adoption of new policies to help women in the workplace. The project will also examine how these organizational conditions affect employee outcomes, such as employee assessment of their fit to the ideal worker norm, and their careers and health. This project shows how changes in the overwork culture may be possible in contemporary American workplaces.<br/><br/>The project conducts a nationally representative, probability-based survey of employees and then matches employee data to organization-level data drawn from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) EEO-1 database. EEO-1 data offer workplace gender and race composition at the establishment level, as well as basic workplace characteristics, such as industry and establishment size. This linked employee-employer data will allow examination of how the ideal worker norm varies by workplace characteristics, and how different organizational conditions influence employee outcomes while controlling for other organizational characteristics.  The probability-based employee sample allows findings to generalize to employed adults working in medium to large organizations in the United States. The employee-employer linked data set will provide a unique opportunity to address questions that span the individual and the organization-level, and in identifying the macro conditions that may reshape the ideal worker norm and its impact on individual workers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, many young adults without postsecondary degrees spin their wheels between low-wage jobs. This project examines factors less reliant on formal education that may facilitate or counteract changes in job quality among young adults without postsecondary degrees. This project provides insights to workers about personal actions they can take while searching for and adjusting to new jobs to improve job quality. For employers and managers, this project clarifies how job tasks and the work environment can facilitate worker development and reduce turnover costs. Findings further inform the design of programs aiming to support young workers moving into better-quality jobs, including programs serving youth from low-income families. <br/><br/>This project advances knowledge by developing and testing models that explain how individual factors (e.g., socioeconomic mobility beliefs), family background (e.g., social class origin), and work and nonwork environmental factors (e.g., workplace practices and government programs) drive changes in job quality. The project team is collaborating with the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development and the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development to collect data and analyze administrative records. The project team is surveying workers aged 18-29 without postsecondary degrees and unemployed at the beginning of the study. Additional rounds of surveys are being fielded as participants search for and adjust to new job(s) over the course of one year. Survey responses are being paired with administrative records. This project extends understanding of the role of behavioral processes during job transitions in intra-generational socioeconomic mobility. This project also contributes to knowledge about the interplay between individual agency and contextual factors shaped by family, work organizations, and government agencies during transitions into early adulthood.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The challenge of understanding and designing work shared with intelligent machines requires a new interdiscipline to grow out of three current domains. The science of human organizing is focused on understanding how individuals, teams, organizations, and industries interact.  Technologies focus on how human work can be facilitated by new technologies such as computational work design, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.  Finally, the emerging field of data science is focused on how data-intensive science and data-driven decision-making can transform work and organizations.  Each of these three domains -- science of human organizing, technologies and data science -- are making breathtaking advances in understanding and enabling the future of work at the human-technology frontier. However, over the past decade, there has been a growing recognition by scholars that the loosely-connected networks in each of these three domains would benefit from better intellectual engagement. The purpose of this workshop is to facilitate that engagement with the goal of helping shape a research agenda at the intersection of these three areas.<br/><br/>This workshop is specifically geared towards charting a research agenda that is at the nexus of recent theoretical and empirical advances in three relatively disparate areas. First, the science of human organizing explores how work changes by novel forms of organizing enabled by technologies such as offshoring (and now reshoring), outsourcing and crowdsourcing, the gig economy and the sharing economy. The second domain of loosely-connected networks focuses on technologies to architect, design, implement and evaluate the platforms, algorithms, intelligent agents, embodied agents, robots as well as intelligent machines to facilitate the future of work at the human-technology frontier. The third domain explores data science methodologies that leverage advances in computing infrastructures and data streams to understand and enable the future of work at the human-technology frontier. While we have witnessed significant intellectual advances in each of these three areas, the challenge is to develop a research agenda that builds on the synergies across these three areas.  The research agenda and ideas developed at the workshop will be a direct response to the promise of the future of work in society.  To paraphrase the noted novelist and thought leader, William Gibson, the future is here -- but it is not evenly distributed.  The goal of this workshop is to leverage recent technological advances but to temper the exuberance associated with technological developments with a reasoned and principled theoretical and empirical understanding of the social dynamics that are afforded by these technological developments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, for firefighters struggling with stress, the ""fire service culture"" discourages showing weakness and seeking help, contributing to their struggles. These issues have led to staffing issues and a shortage of recruits in many areas. This project examines various coping strategies as well as the influence of fire service culture that varies across departments, stations, and shifts. Focusing on the impact of the fire service culture provides unique insight into the role of organizational culture on mental health outcomes. Findings of the project contribute to an improved understanding of stress and coping for first responders, ensuring that communities continue to receive high-quality emergency responses while promoting the well-being of first responders.  <br/><br/>This project tests a multilevel model of the effects of fire service culture, operationalized as masculinity contest culture, a culture that emphasizes competition, risk, and hiding weaknesses. Through stratified random sampling, the researchers collect data from employees of fire departments that vary by size, region, and type across the United States. Preliminary data suggest that masculinity contest culture at the team level interacts with individual coping strategies to moderate the effects of stressors on emotional states and ultimately mental health (e.g., PTSD and suicidal ideation) and job outcomes (e.g., job withdrawal, job performance, and turnover intentions). The findings help to diagnose the role of culture more precisely in the stress and coping process and connect the dots for organizational interventions that can promote healthy coping and potentially mitigate the effects of various job stressors. In addition to more traditional stressors, this project addresses key pandemic stressors that can be of interest to other researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. The award disseminates the findings in a variety of academic and practitioner outlets so that it reaches not only other academics but also leaders in first responder organizations.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Science of Organizations Program (SoO) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Team members with diverse expertise and an awareness of ""who knows what"" perform better than teams with less diverse perspectives. Since 2013, the National Science Foundation's SaTC program has piloted groups of  ""high risk-high reward"" EAGER projects to encourage early collaborations between computer and information scientists and behavioral, social, and economic scientists towards improving innovation and effectiveness in SaTC research. The current research will review the experiences of researchers and the outcomes of their projects to better understand that initiative. The project will also allow for insights into how interdisciplinary teams manage the inherent tension between knowledge convergence and divergence. Converging when diverging is needed or diverging when converging is needed mishandles team resources, impairing team processes and performance. Therefore, unlocking the simultaneous influences of knowledge convergence and divergence is central to improving team effectiveness as well as advancing team research in the decades to come. Because NSF and other granting agencies increasingly require team members to represent different disciplines, it is urgent to discover the benefits, limitations, and objective outcomes of promoting collaboration across NSF's directorates. As such, this research has the potential to improve the effectiveness of SaTC, and more generally, science teams, thereby fostering scientific breakthroughs.<br/><br/>How should knowledge convergence and divergence in teams be balanced to maximize performance, innovation, and member satisfaction? The objectives of this research are to 1) conceptually integrate the previously independent areas of team research that have focused either on knowledge convergence or knowledge divergence 2) create new methods to assess the balance (or lack of balance) between knowledge convergence and divergence in teams, and 3) begin to assess the simultaneous effect of knowledge convergence and divergence on team effectiveness. These objectives are fittingly explored in the context of nearly 100 SaTC NSF-funded, cross-disciplinary teams. The first phase of the project involves interviews with members of a subset of interdisciplinary teams to develop metrics to assess the balance of knowledge convergence and divergence. The second phase involves surveys of past and currently funded team members to measure the simultaneous effect of knowledge convergence and divergence on objective outcomes. Outcome metrics assess, from publicly-available data, whether the projects were productive and whether investigators co-published and continued their cross-disciplinary collaboration. Together, these qualitative and quantitative studies advance the rapidly growing science of team science literature which has relied mostly on descriptive and archival research rather than primary data collection.

In recent decades, there has been growing societal demand for organizations to attend to their ESG-related responsibilities. While organizations are under intense evaluation for their involvement in ESG, most of the popular ESG ratings used by both academics and the investor community are produced by third-party rating agencies. These ratings are largely a black box, with little transparency of the underlying input data or the methodologies that have been employed to produce these ratings. It is thus risky for the academic and the broader investor communities to over-rely on such third party-generated ratings due to the lack of accuracy, transparency, or reproducibility. As a result, constructing a new ESG measure with improved quality and transparency is desired, which motivates this project.<br/><br/>With the assumption that organizations need human capital to get the work done, jobs offered by organizations reveal important information about organizational priorities. This project leverages recent availability of 250 million job-postings from 2008 to 2023 (and are still being updated) for 60,000 companies of various sizes to compute a job-posting-based novel ESG measure. The team employs the pre-train and fine-tune paradigm of text representation learning, upon which a fine-tuned large-language model (LLM) coupled with a neural network-based classifier is developed and applied to the textual job postings for constructing the ESG measure. The project aims at delivering three sets of output: (1) a new measure of organizational ESG engagement (and relevant scores in sub-categories), (2) the generic framework and methodology underlying the construction of this new measure, and (3) a report and a re-evaluation study of a widely-cited research article on ESG. All three sets of products contribute to organizational research on ESG and will be shared with the public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The benefits of leading by serving the needs of others are well-known, especially in the context of organizational leadership. Yet, few studies have investigated predictors of servant leadership and none have investigated how leaders develop to think and behave in ways that create a cycle of servant leadership. Motivated by state-of-the-art leadership and cognitive psychology theories, this project will systematically investigate the antecedents of servant leadership.  The project integrates established measures from organizational and cognitive psychology and tests how the following relate to one?s practice as a servant leader: (1) Theory of Mind (i.e. one?s understanding of the thoughts, emotions, and intentions of another), (2) ability to recognize (i.e., perceive and categorize) the essential characteristics of servant leadership, and (3) specific first-hand experience in serving and/or leading. This project will examine the nature of experiences that influence these factors. Specific aims include studying how Theory of Mind and leadership recognition affect leadership development to advance knowledge about how such cognitive and social processes interact and systematically capturing the antecedents of servant leader development to inform the practice of organizational servant leadership development, by clarifying how components of cognition, and specific experiences, play a role in leadership emergence. The proposed research is interdisciplinary, integrating cognitive and organizational psychology, building a bridge between areas of psychology that have traditionally been studied separately. This project promotes the involvement of a diverse set of students from underrepresented groups. Undergraduate students will be mentored through all aspects of the research by two faculty PIs (each with a different area of expertise ?

Three extremes include a) millions of employees now working remotely (telecommuting), b) millions more furloughed, laid off, or suddenly unemployed, and c) a third group of ?essential employees? continuing to work in public at great risk to their own health. Such rapid changes in the structure of individual work conditions have led to unique challenges and pressures for these three groups. Further, the divisions of employees into each of the aforementioned groups may exacerbate societal disadvantages already noted in science and practice, including socioeconomic status (SES) and race because these divisions are seen in the types of jobs that allow for (or mandate) continued work through social distancing requirements instituted by federal and state governments. Thus, the current project will examine how such rapid changes in work structure and status have differentially affected employees across various levels of job structure, SES, and race. The researchers will examine (1) how these changes affect employee outcomes (including job attitudes, health and wellbeing, and job performance), and (2) the ways in which organizational responses to COVID-19 helped to mitigate (or exacerbate) these outcomes. This study seeks to advance the field of organizational science by uncovering the ways in which continued changes in occupational structure and organizational responses interact to influence employees over time. Further, this project will provide information used to potentially develop recommendations for organizational and government policy regarding best practices in handling societal-level crises of this magnitude in the future.<br/> <br/>The primary objectives of this project are to (1) empirically examine how rapid changes in work conditions due to COVID-19 have differentially affected workers across various levels of job structure, SES, and race, and (2) examine how organizational responses to COVID-19 have affected the relationship between such job changes and employee well-being. By collecting survey and open-response data from employees (and those unemployed) across four months, we aim to examine how job structure changes affect job-related attitudes and behavior and well-being. Further, we seek to identify factors that may affect these variables (e.g., financial security, changes in childcare).

This is because behind headline-grabbing stories of digital advances, digital technologies fundamentally reshape an organization?s relationships with data. Once a firm?s senior leadership decides to ?go digital,? as many often describe it, they need to deal with the backend complexity by focusing on the relationship between digital technology, data, and the organization of work. Despite the importance of the role that data collected, stored, and accessed through digital technologies plays in successful digital transformation, we know very little about how certain types of technology use affect and use data in ways that produce changes to the informal organization of work than we do about how to set corporate strategy for digital change. In this study, we begin with the assumption that new digital technologies provide only potential for new ways of organizing and getting work done. To bring about a successful digital transformation, the new data-related capabilities enabled by digital technology must be made into resources that people can actually use. <br/>To understand how the transition to digital technologies affects organizations and what how data provided by digital technologies are activated into communication networks, digital transformation needs to be studied both before and after new digital technology implementation. One timely opportunity is the fact that many cities across the country are planning for major initiatives to install several advanced digital technologies to better manage water across their municipalities.  We will conduct a multi-year ethnographic study at five municipal water agencies to investigate how data affects tasks, roles and networks before, during and after implementation. We will use both qualitative and quantitative methods to answer the following questions: 1) How do stakeholders within water utilities select and prepare for data-intensive technologies? 2)How do organizations use data from new data-intensive technologies for the work of leak detection, preventative maintenance and disaster preparedness? 3) What effects do digital technologies have on the organization of water utilities regarding tasks, roles and networks within the organization? 4) How does information use compare between different types of departments and different occupational groups? The findings of the study will shape our understanding of what work technology is equipped to do, how organizational members should be trained to work with new digital technologies and the analytic capabilities they require, and how to mitigate unintended consequences of using the digital technologies to guide the work and communication practices in organizations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One factor that is critical to building psychological safety is leader behavior. Most of the research has failed to consider that psychological safety may be cultivated in unique ways for employees who are members of socially disadvantaged groups, particularly for those in intersecting demographic categories who often experience unique challenges based on their intersecting social identities. Given the workforce has become increasingly diverse, building understanding of how leaders can best cultivate psychological safety among these groups of employees is a critical step to fully realizing the advantages of a workforce in which employees feel psychologically safe. As such, the project team is collecting data to support the development of actionable, evidence-based interventions that will help managers develop communication and leadership skills that effectively cultivate psychological safety of employees. The findings will support the development of leader skill trainings in organizations. <br/><br/>The primary objective of this project is to build a more comprehensive understanding of the specific contextual factors that impact the psychological safety of members of some demographic categories at work, with the broader goal of improving diverse employees? work lives and helping organizations to retain top diverse talent.

Trust can be broadly defined as an individual?s willingness to make him- or herself vulnerable to the actions of another party. Trust is a critical ingredient in facilitating collective undertakings across a variety of social settings?particularly within and across organizations. A first focus of this project is on understanding the circumstances under which people make trust decisions that are accurate?that is, neither misplace their trust nor refrain from trusting when their partner would reciprocate and be trustworthy. When will actors place trust to an extent that is commensurate with their counterpart?s trustworthiness? Second, the project will investigate trust asymmetries?situations in which one party places high trust in the other, whereas the other party places low trust in return. What types of settings produce persistent trust asymmetries, and what are their consequences? Third and finally, do people know how much they are being trusted? This question addresses the notion of trust meta accuracy?an individual's ability to predict the degree to which a partner trusts them. What factors aid people in deciphering others? trust in them, and what are the consequences of (in)accurately reading someone?s trust? Overall, trust decisions that are more accurate, relationships that are more symmetric, and a better ability to predict one's counterpart's trust all have the potential to shape relationship outcomes, both in terms of economic effectiveness and personal wellbeing.<br/><br/>The project takes a bilateral approach to study trust from both the trustor and trustee perspectives. The project uses a variety of complementary empirical methods to investigate trust accuracy, trust asymmetry, and trust meta accuracy. The investigation of trust accuracy is based on a series of lab experiments using established experimental tasks; the study of trust asymmetries is conducted in a field setting of firm-bank relationships and uses key informant surveys of managers and bankers; trust meta accuracy is examined in the field context of interorganizational buyer-seller relationships as well as in a scenario experiment.

Recently developed information technologies in text analysis will be utilized to analyze and synthesize the information obtained from existing data and media coverage to build a large database of politically connected boards of directors and top managers of the largest publicly listed firms in multiple countries over time. One study will provide extensive and in-depth documentation of both the dynamic patterns of changes to political connections over time and the geographic distribution across different countries. The second set of analyses will investigate the effect of financial crises on the hiring of politically connected leaders by top listed firms. Various econometric analyses will be conducted in order to identify the causal effect of financial crises on corporate political connections. The third set of analyses will focus on how the distribution of firm size in each country change in association with changes to top listed firms' political connections. The project will advance scholarship in business organizations and political economy, particularly regarding the process through which businesses build political connections. It will also advance the research insights on how multi-country institutional contexts exert different influence on the formation and dissolution of political connections.

Although organizational structures compartmentalized according to specific expertise can produce efficiencies, this fragmentation becomes problematic when governments attempt to address complex problems that transcend multiple units. Urban sustainability is an exemplar of issues which cut across numerous responsibilities traditionally held by distinct units within a single government organization. This research examines the relationship between municipal governments? administrative arrangements, their policy adoption and implementation choices, and sustainability outcomes. It highlights the role of lead unit cross-functional authority?which we define as the clout that an initiative?s administrative lead has over other relevant units in the city government?and assesses its impact on local sustainability outcomes. In so doing, this research contributes to an evidence-based understanding of how public organizations function in order to enhance their design, management, and overall effectiveness.<br/><br/>This work advances convergence research drawing from organizational, policy, sustainable urban systems, and network science to increase the precision and robustness of the Functional Collective Action (FCA) framework. It provides important insight into the determinants of lead agency cross-functional authority?which extant research has highlighted as fundamental but inadequately operationalized?and its influence on policy outcome. Using urban sustainability as our policy lens, we employ a mixed-methods approach to collect and analyze data from focus groups of local government officials, public and private archival repositories, and a nationwide survey to: (a) develop a refined conceptualization and empirical measure of cross-functional authority that captures its various dimensions and mechanisms of influence; (b) develop a comprehensive national dataset of multiple sustainability outcome measures that are comparable across cities; and (c) create the first longitudinal database on local sustainability policies spanning a ten year period, which is often considered the minimum amount of time necessary for nuanced examination of policy implementation and policy change. The collection of data will enable improved testing of local institutional and governance theories and its analysis will facilitate advances in urban management and sustainability outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will focus on health and healthcare work, with is a context likely to be affected by datafication and automation and likely to provide STEM-related careers for individuals who have the right skills. In healthcare, automation may help providers prevent medical errors, lower the costs of caregiving, and augment or create new forms of work, but the success of such systems depends on how they are designed and implemented. By focusing on the actual communication involved in automation, the project will generate theoretical insights and practical recommendations for leaders in health and analytics organizations, regarding (a) what makes the communication involved in data-intensive automation effective or not, and (b) how to structure and facilitate that communication. The research will be used to create short films and a learning module for students making key career decisions. The films and module will be designed to reach groups underrepresented in STEM and to provide information about STEM careers affected by automation and STEM-related, communication competencies. The project will help students at community colleges and universities understand and prepare for the opportunities and challenges of automation.<br/><br/>Recent research has demonstrated that automation is determined not merely by the features of new technology or pressures to make work more efficient, but by a complex, communicatively-negotiated mix of workers' and managers' ideas about factors such as market forces, professional standards, regulation, industry knowledge, and human and technology workflows. Automation involves intertwined changes in the technologies and organization of work. These changes unfold in and through everyday communication about how work is and ought to be accomplished. Using a combination of interview and observational methods, the project will investigate two theoretically and practically important contexts: (1) Healthcare organizations that develop and implement technologies such as automated metrics dashboards and clinical decisions support systems, and (2) Quantified Self communities where practitioners of personal analytics are creating new human-technology partnerships, new forms of work and play, through automation.

Considering these demands, this project will identify the impacts of body worn camera technologies on individual work dynamics and organizational operations in US police departments. Specifically, this project will develop a larger IT governance framework to maximize the value of body worn camera technologies for effective policing operations. This project will expand knowledge on the management of public sector organizations that are increasingly enmeshed with wearable Internet of Things technologies like body worn cameras, and research results will inform the development of educational materials in technology management, law and criminology, and information systems. <br/><br/>A primary goal of this project is to create an evidence-based organization theory and IT governance framework for public sector organizations that are being increasingly embedded with digital technologies in general and Internet of Things technologies in particular. Specific to the impacts of body worn cameras (BWC) on policing organizations, this project addresses three questions: (1) What individual work dynamics and organizational changes are induced by BWC systems; (2) what technosocial governance mechanisms help maximize the value of BWCs in accomplishing police departments' mission; and (3) what empirical evidence explains the effects of BWCs on the operational and mission performance of police departments. This research activity answers these questions through a three-stage research design.

The introduction of artificially intelligent (AI) assistants to workplaces and their effect on organizational performance has garnered both excitement and concern. While some executives praise AI and laud its value as a solution for organizational problems, other workers fear that artificial intelligence will threaten and displace their work. This study avoids such generalizations by focusing on how the use of artificially intelligent agents in scheduling shapes how managers direct their attention, which in turn shapes organizational performance and the economy at large. Understanding these processes is important because of the broad consequences that entrusting attention management to AI will have, from influencing innovation to enabling or inhibiting organizational learning by affecting the knowledge to which organizations have access. The findings of the study will shape our understanding of what work technology is equipped to do, how organizational members should be trained to work with AI, and how to mitigate unintended consequences of using AI to guide our decision making.<br/><br/>This project investigates how decisions about time and attention are outsourced to both AI and human agents and utilizes ethnographic methods to gather rich interview and observational data from several field sites. In doing so, the study contributes to intellectual conversations in three main areas. First, the findings of this study will help revise existing theoretical work using an attention-based view of the firm to show how other people shape leaders' attention. Second, the findings will develop new theory about the relationship between time and attention. Though existing empirical evidence suggests that decisions about time affect attention allocation, the proposed comparative study will provide greater understanding of the mechanisms through which decisions about time come to bear on attention.

This project addresses the relationship between multiple team membership (MTM) and wellbeing, crucial for organizational productivity. Individuals navigating multiple virtual teams experience ?context variety.? In other words, they move between diverse technological, task-related, and socio-psychological contexts. This includes using different platforms and emerging technologies (e.g., AI nudging tools), facing varying task requirements, and experiencing different levels of inclusion and psychological safety across teams.

The project focuses on multiple levels of analyses: the individual, the single team, and the meso-level, which is defined as a liminal space across multiple teams within an organization. The research team relies on a mixed method approach, including interviews to capture a holistic view of the lived experiences of multiple team membership of knowledge workers and develop a theoretical model, experiments to granularly analyze technology affordances, and surveys to confirm the proposed theoretical model we develop and to better capture variety in task and socio-psychological contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This complexity often hides the locus of decision making, raising key problems of accountability for citizens and interest groups of all kinds. Public policy governance systems offer important opportunities to understand these dynamics and their consequences, because public policy by nature attempts to adjudicate among competing interests to produce some form of public good.  This project examines legislators' decisions to allocate public funds to private nonprofit organizations that provide social services in a large city.  As the proportion of publicly-supported welfare services privately provided has grown, nonprofit organizations increasingly mediate the relationship between local legislators and their constituencies. In turn, nonprofits have become increasingly dependent on government contracts, leaving the amount and quality of public services that citizens experience greatly affected by nonprofits' location and capacity to attract funding. <br/><br/>How legislators allocate discretionary public funds to nonprofits reveals two key dynamics of social welfare governance: patronage relationships between legislators, their constituencies, and local nonprofits; and political exchange relationships between legislators. Patronage involves delivering and claiming credit for public resources allocated to a legislator's district. Presumably, the reward for successful patronage is re-election by one's constituents.  Political exchange involves deals cut among legislators that lead to the allocation of public resources to a legislator's district, and/or to specific votes on legislation. Focusing on the network structure produced by this governance system and its consequences for specific citizen constituencies, this project asks: (1) What is the structure of patronage relationships between municipal legislators and their district constituencies? And how does it relate to the re-election prospects of municipal legislators, the growth of nonprofit organizations, and citizens' needs? (2) What is the structure of political exchange relationships among municipal legislators? And what are legislators' individual and district characteristics that make them more likely to initiate and reciprocate exchange patterns? (3) How does the structure of political exchange relate to whether consequential legislative proposals are passed?<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This project contributes to three distinct literatures: (1) By studying sociological processes through a social network approach, it provides a contemporary picture of patronage patterns at the community level, assesses the mutual dependence of legislators and nonprofit organizations, and evaluates the distributive consequences for citizens' welfare. (2) Public administration scholars are concerned with the relative balance of managerial best practices and distributional equity in state administration. This is the first study that examines how patronage fits into a larger system of merit-based public service contracting. (3) This project also advances political science's understanding of distributive politics by disentangling mechanisms of patronage and exchange at the local level.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: In conjunction with prior NSF-funded work, this project will allow comparison of 3 mechanisms of public resource allocation to nonprofit organizations: patronage, political exchange, and competition. Project results will be communicated via a written policy brief and presentations to audiences in government, the nonprofit sector, and the media. The dataset resulted from the project will offer an important resource to scholars, practitioners, and government officials. It also provides a model set of procedures for constructing datasets for other cities or states that have similar discretionary forms of public resource allocation."

Scientific understanding of people's behavior during hurricanes, floods, and other natural disaster has, for example, led to the development of safer evacuation procedures, while studies of how children learn have helped improve education policy. However, the mechanisms by which such knowledge makes its way into public policy contexts are not fully understood. In an era of increasingly complex policy challenges, defined and acted upon by a diverse and wide-ranging set of stakeholders (e.g. legislators, public administrators, and community leaders), the successful transfer of scientific knowledge requires an in-depth understanding of policy development and implementation. Understanding the interactions between science and policy will help governments and communities better leverage scientific discoveries into beneficial policy innovations.  <br/> <br/>Building on the findings from a previous workshop titled ""Catalyzing Discovery for Social Impact: Exploring the Power of the Research-Academic-Policy Nexus to Stimulate Policy Innovation,"" this workshop will explore, in particular, the role of entrepreneurial scientists in facilitating the exchange of knowledge between science and policy.  Social and behavioral scientists are often not trained in how to transfer their knowledge into the public sector.  Therefore, a major element of this challenge is identifying and developing the necessary skill sets social scientists need to help catalyze the transformation of their research into practical application.  This workshop will convene a dynamic group of the nation's top researchers, thought leaders, and curriculum developers who are actively studying or writing about the challenges posed by the creation and sustainability of strong academic-research-policy relationships.  Utilizing participatory action methods and drawing on participants' expertise and experience, this workshop will collaboratively build a skills inventory and a curriculum to build such skills."

This research has found that police forces rapidly moved from endorsing a model for protest policing that relied on force to stop protests (referred to as ""escalated force"") to a new model that was based on de-escalating conflict through negotiation (referred to as ""negotiated management""). However, this existing work does not adequately: (1) explain how this new alternative developed, (2) examine whether other alternative models developed and competed for adherents; (3) analyze how factors internal to policing, such as police professionalism, affected this process of selection and change; and (4) problematize how organizations are affected by legal mandates. These are critical oversights because major organizational theories have long been able to explain the diffusion of new policies but have not been able to explain where those new policies come from. <br/><br/>This project draws on work from science and technology studies to develop a new perspective on how alternative innovations are created and compete for implementation. Specific hypotheses anticipate: multiple competing alternatives; that alternatives that were consistent with specific elements of police professionalism were more successful competitors; and that the courts did not directly dictate how police forces changed. Data are drawn from quantitative and qualitative content coding of historical police journals and other documents. Analyses map alternatives and their characteristics and track the prevalence of themes identified by the qualitative coding.

However, developing and implementing strategy typically requires many members of both upper and middle management to communicate and shape strategy through formal (top-down) and/or informal (lateral, upward) processes of influence. Unfortunately, the patterns of communication and informal influence that often arise among upper- and middle-level management groups can pose problems for strategic effectiveness. Such leadership failures are common, costly, and cannot be addressed without a better understanding of who will lead and who will follow in the upper layers of organizations. Although prior research has examined the characteristics of top executives to understand firm effectiveness, scholars agree that how top managers and middle-level managers need to interact to propel their firms toward greater success remains a ?black box'. This project delves into this black box by advancing and testing new theory related to the multilevel causes and consequences of the networked patterns of leadership and communication processes that emerge in the upper levels of organizations. By studying the complex dynamics inherent in the leadership of large organizations, this project directly and positively impacts each participating organization as well as the aggregate economy that relies on these organizations. <br/><br/>This project leverages partnerships with the Center for Creative Leadership (CCL) and the Gutierrez Energy Management Institute (GEMI) in order to conduct survey- and interview-based research with upper- and middle-level managers from approximately 50-75 organizations from a variety of industries (Study 1) and approximately 25 organizations within the Energy Industry -- an industry that is vital to national interests (Study 2). As a recruitment incentive, our research team is providing tailored feedback for each participating organization in the form of an hour-long virtual debrief presentation and personalized report delivered to senior executives. To maximize internal validity, field study results are being combined with a large-scale controlled laboratory experiment manipulating the drivers of leadership and communication networks in hierarchical multi-group systems (Study 3). Therefore, this research program connects micro-, meso-, and macro-level organizational theories and corresponding research methods in order to address critical and unanswered questions related to the drivers and outcomes of informal leadership and communication networks in the upper levels of organizations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One prominent example is the adoption and deployment of body-worn cameras by law enforcement organizations. Body worn cameras are small video and audio recording devices that law enforcement officers wear when in the field and when interacting with the public. Body-worn cameras have a variety of technological features that can potentially transform officer training, accountability, and performance, and increase or decrease community trust in law enforcement. However, previous findings on the effects of body-worn cameras on individuals and organizations have varied widely. The goal of this project is to better understand how individual, organizational, environmental, and technological factors interact to influence how officers and the communities they serve respond to body-worn cameras.    <br/><br/>The project collects data from multiple sources to answer research questions about the effects of body-worn cameras. In the first phase of data collection, the project team collects survey data from patrol officers working in nearly 60 agencies that use body-worn cameras. The surveys include measures of burnout, well-being, proactivity, and attitudes regarding their organizations and body-worn cameras. The project team also conducts interviews with high-ranking officers from each of these agencies to better understand body-worn camera implementation in each agency. In the second phase of data collection, community members from each of the jurisdictions that the participating law enforcement agencies serve are surveyed regarding their attitudes about their local agency and about law enforcement technologies. Community sentiments are triangulated using by colling data from social media posts using natural language processing techniques. These multi-level multi-source data allow the project team to test a model of the effects of body-worn cameras on officers and communities and create fundamental knowledge about the ways organizations operate in modern digital contexts, building critical theoretical groundwork to inform future design and policy of body-worn camera use in law enforcement organizations. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Science of Organizations Program (SoO) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Collaboration is an important way for firms to learn from one another and innovate. At the same time, consumers signal approval of innovations through ratings platforms, such as those found on online retail websites. The craft brewing industry is a strategic research site for examining such industry-consumer dynamics in the context of small-scale manufacturing. Interorganizational collaboration is common within this industry. This industry also has a community of consumers who actively rate products on public websites. Like organizations in many industries, small-scale manufactures vary in their strategies for collaborating: some collaborate with many other firms; others with the same firm repeatedly; still others collaborate once and never again. Over time, patterns of interorganizational collaboration structure industries. This project will construct and analyze a dataset from two product rating sites to model the network of collaborations among manufactures in three states in the U.S. Combined with interviews with a random sample of organizational members from the dataset, analyses will show how consumer ratings influence decisions to collaborate among small-scale manufactures and ultimately shape the industry. Findings will bring together and contribute to the literatures on valuation in economic sociology and collaboration in organization science as well as inform managers? strategic decisions regarding collaborations and their prospective outcomes.<br/><br/> <br/>This project identifies and explains a key mechanism by which industries are structured: the recursive relationship between consumer ratings and interorganizational collaborations. Interorganizational collaboration takes place when organizations cooperate in a non-hierarchical relationship to share knowledge and resources and to innovate in ways that would be too risky to do independently. Status plays an important role in why firms choose certain others with whom to collaborate. Communities of consumers increasingly take advantage of online platforms to rate producers and products, creating an alternative measure of firm and product valuation and status. This project will bring together the literatures on interorganizational collaborations and valuation by determining and explaining the role of consumer ratings in strategic decisions about collaboration. Data for this project will come from a mixed methods study of the small manufacturing industry in three states: California, Colorado, and Illinois between 2009 and 2016. These states have been selected to provide robust samples of collaborations. The time frame reflects the exponential growth in the industry nationally. Quantitative data will come from two rating websites, which will provide evidence of collaborations along with consumer valuations of the products resulting from collaborations. Analyses of this data will provide dynamic network models of the industry as well as concrete measures of status among firms. This data will be supplemented with primary data collected from organizational members in the sample. Investigators will also conduct key informant interviews with a random sample to identify non-measurable features of status and motivations behind choices of collaborators."

This large-scale database will contain information on products and services directly offered by public and private firms to their customers over the last 20 years, as well as links to the US Patent and Trademark Office's patent data for the last 20 years. The resulting database and analysis tool will enable researchers to answer many questions, including: How do industries, competition in industries and their products change over time? What are the dynamics of product introduction rates for private and public firms and how did private firms and their array of product offerings change during the recent financial crisis? What products are introduced by public and private firms following increases in patenting activity within an industry? Do the patenting firms introduce the new products or do non-patenting firms? Which government policy changes were most effective in stimulating the growth of entrepreneurial firms, and in what kind of markets did these policies work best? What local product market conditions are most conducive to successful entry by entrepreneurial firms and how do waves of innovation impact product market competition? What economic forces trigger firms to cross the boundary between public and private status? In addition to impacting academics that study innovation and how industries change over time, business decision makers, consumers, and regulators will benefit from the new industry designations. Businesses can use the database and web based tool to assess existing market structure around new products. This will facilitate more informed decisions about where and when to commit scarce resources to enter new markets. By examining the nature of existing competition and market structure by both public and private firms, large and small, entrepreneurs can also better assess the likely success of their new ventures. Regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) can also benefit from refined knowledge of industry structure and product market boundaries. <br/><br/>This project will produce a highly scalable approach for mining historical Web data to create comprehensive product-based databases and tools to query and analyze this data. This integrated database will be built using firm web pages from the Internet Archive Wayback Machine project. Using the text from these web pages, the resulting database will classify firms as competitors, which will be used to build new industry definitions. These new industry definitions will be based directly on the product and service descriptions firms use to interface with customers. The project will produce a publicly available web-based analytical tool based on ""Elasticsearch"" (www.elasticsearch.com). This tool will allow users to query the database of public and private firms, their competitors, and the products they offer. Using this tool, a user will be able to input a company, or list of companies, and the tool will provide that company's product descriptions and a list of its competitors that produce similar products, along with the corresponding similarity scores, indicating the strength of competitive links. The analytical tool will also allow a firm's local product market to be visualized as a network. In addition to the hosted, online search tool, users will be able to download bulk datasets to perform their own local processing."

Such routines are believed to be responsible for the efficiency advantages of organizations as structures for collective decision-making. Nevertheless, to date there has been little formal modeling or evidence collected as to how organizational routines emerge, endure and adapt to change. This project proposes an agenda for studying the emergence, maintenance, adaptability and optimality of organizational routines that combines game theoretic analysis with experimental evidence. The baseline model is a novel but simple ""harvesting game"" wherein teams of agents repeatedly harvest a grid over several periods with full information about all past choices. The team's goal is to uncover as many novel outcomes on the grid as possible in the time allowed but without the ability to communicate with one another. The absence of communication proxies for specialization by team members that makes communication difficult or for settings where communication is impractical, for example during an emergency response. In such environments there are easily identifiable optimal routines and this study examines both theoretically and experimentally which routines emerge, how long it takes them to emerge, whether they are stable once they emerge, and if agents make short-run sacrifices in the interest of promoting the emergence of optimal routines. <br/><br/>This research will build upon and extend the baseline model by studying routine formation in variants where 1) there is no information about past choices, 2) the complexity of the decision task is increased, 3) more players are added, 4) some players have private, payoff-relevant information that may naturally position them as team leaders and 5) players have the ability to communicate with one another prior to making their harvesting decisions. The new framework will broaden understanding of how members of organizations learn to form routines in a variety of different environments that are all amenable to theoretical and experimental evaluation. Thus will bring game-theoretic analysis and rigor to the organizational routine literature which to date has been studied using the methods of psychology and organizational behavior researchers. The game-theoretic framework allows one to assess the extent and source of deviations in routine formation from the rational choice ideal so that there is a better understanding of the role played by bounded rationality in routine formation. In addition, data on organizational routines are difficult to measure or observe -- the experimental tests proposed using the methods of experimental economics, where subjects earn payments based on their own choices and the choices of other members of their same team, provides an excellent framework in which to study organizational routines. The experimental designs, programs, data and findings resulting from this proposal will be made freely available so that other researchers can build upon the new framework and instructors can teach this new approach to organizational routines in the classroom."

It is becoming increasingly important, therefore, to understand how to improve the performance of these groups.  The work proposed here will use a new measure of generalized group effectiveness -- called ""collective intelligence"" -- to help do this.  <br/><br/>Building on previous work by the investigators, the project will first develop an online test for collective intelligence.  Then it will compare the results of online and face-to-face groups taking this new test with previous results for groups taking an offline version of the test.  This will help clarify the degree to which online and off-line groups differ in their general effectiveness on a wide range of different tasks.  Next the project will use this test to systematically measure the collective intelligence of online groups that range in size from 2 to 20 people.  This will lay the foundation for exploring whether larger online groups can take advantage of the increased resources that more people bring, without suffering as much from the process losses that usually accompany increased group size in face-to-face groups.  Finally, the project will systematically measure the collective intelligence of online groups with varying proportions of women.  In doing so, the project will also test one particularly promising explanation for a gender effect on group performance:  that groups with more women are less interpersonally competitive, and that this lower intra-group competitiveness leads to higher collective intelligence. <br/><br/>While there have been decades of research on factors that affect the performance of groups, almost all these studies have each focused on a single task.  Thus, strictly speaking, the lessons to be learned from this previous work are limited to the specific tasks studied.  The work proposed here uses the perspective of collective intelligence to investigate, not just the ability of a group to perform a single task, but the group?s general ability to perform a wide range of tasks.  Since many real-world groups must cope with a wide range of problems, just such a perspective may be needed to systematically predict their performance.  In addition, the approach developed here can provide a significant economy of effort in evaluating potential ways of improving online group effectiveness.  Instead of testing interventions on many different specific tasks, researchers will be able to test the interventions once with this general measure, and then have some basis for predicting the effects of the intervention on many other tasks.  By making an online test of collective intelligence available to other researchers, the project will help advance scientific practice in this area.  More generally, by providing a firmer scientific foundation for measuring and improving the performance of groups, the project may help our society address many of its most important problems more effectively.  For instance, with the right kinds of collaboration tools, online groups may be able to be much more effective than face-to-face groups, taking advantage of the simultaneous efforts of far more people without the coordination losses that usually occur in larger groups.  And understanding the dynamics of gender diversity may help us to improve the collaboration of the groups in which both men and women work, by giving everyone?s best ideas a better chance to be heard. And perhaps, someday, this will help create groups that are more collectively intelligent than any groups have ever been before."

Ventures like this are outliers because they are rare and have disproportionate impact at multiple levels. Moreover, these outlier ventures are very different in both their inputs and outcomes than what most would characterize as typical. The project's framework will enhance knowledge of how organizational systems grow, improve performance, and achieve outlier outcomes over time in changing competitive environments. Because this framework is built on data from multiple complex social systems, it is generalizable for and capable of improving the outcomes of individuals, teams, firms, industries, and nations. <br/><br/>The overarching research focus of this project is to identify the primary drivers of outlier outcomes in entrepreneurship. Building a theory about the emergence of outliers is difficult under the assumption of normal, bell-shaped distributions of inputs and outcomes. Under the normal distribution assumption, outliers are usually cleansed from the analysis-either deleted or mathematically transformed-to reduce their influence. This project moves beyond the normal distribution assumption and uses theoretical assumptions and methods from complexity science. This theoretical approach has two advantages. First, a complexity perspective assumes that in relatively unconstrained environments, outcomes will likely be distributed according to a power law. This distribution is vital because traditional theory building and testing methods assume that the probability of an extreme event is effectively zero. A power law assumption can more adequately reflect the empirical distributions found in studies of emerging ventures. Second, a complexity perspective suggests that a system's outcomes are primarily the result of an interconnected combinations of inputs, including 1) an agent's initial endowment of resources, 2) the agent's rules for engagement with other agents based on expectations for future outcomes, and 3) the quantity and quality of environmental resources. Within this perspective, the emergence of a system from non-existence to existence occurs as a nonlinear, threshold-based process. This project uses non-parametric maximum-likelihood bootstrap estimates of power law fit on representative samples of nascent entrepreneurial ventures to derive a meta-construct framework of inputs that apply to all organizational forms: endowments, expectations, engagement, and environments. Then, to test this generalizable 4E framework, these inputs are used to build an agent-based simulation model, the outcomes for which will be validated with empirical data from the fastest growing privately held firms."

As a result of this work-family conflict, a parent may experience low morale at work, stress, and depression, all of which have profound effects on their work engagement and productivity. Such tension between work and family may potentially impact the home environment as well, including negative effects on how adolescent children in the family think, feel, and behave. However, we know little about these effects, and also whether a negative home environment may have similarly negative effects on parents at work. Our project seeks to study work-family conflict and its effects on the home environment (and vice versa) using controlled laboratory methods, and methods that allow for the study of these factors in ""real-life"" outside of the laboratory. By understanding the ways in which work-family conflict and the home environment influence each other, we may gain a better understanding of how to improve functioning in both work and home domain, and thus increase parents' work engagement and productivity.     <br/><br/>Many employees in the U.S. experience high demands to fulfill obligations both at work and at home (Galinsky et al. 2009). The incompatibility of heightened pressure from both work and home is referred to as work-family conflict (Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985), high levels of which place employees at increased risk for a host of poor work and psychosocial outcomes (e.g., job dissatisfaction, turnover, depression; Allen, 2012). Moreover, to the extent that child care poses demands in the family domain (Bianchi & Milkie, 2010), the children of employees are important stakeholders in the work-family interface. Yet, the role of employees? children in absorbing the impact or being a source of work-family conflict has received scant attention. Such issues are particularly important to address in families with adolescents. Specifically, work-family conflict creates contexts in which parents have fewer resources or time to monitor their adolescents' whereabouts and activities, likely placing adolescents at high risk for poor psychosocial outcomes (Smetana, 2008). In fact, relative to younger children, adolescents are more likely to display problem behaviors (e.g., depression and substance abuse) that increase parent-adolescent conflict, which may affect parents' time and energy at work. Thus, we propose to address research questions within families who have adolescent children. Specifically, we propose two studies that test both directions of a mediation model informed by the spillover hypothesis of life stressors (Staines, 1980). Based on prior work indicating that parent-adolescent conflict evidences reciprocal relations with children's psychosocial adjustment (Burt et al., 2005), we propose that the reciprocal relations between work-family conflict and adolescent psychosocial maladjustment are mediated by parent-adolescent conflict. Further, our team members have training in not only diverse social science disciplines, but also diverse research settings. Accordingly, we propose two studies that test the model described previously in both field and laboratory settings, allowing each study's strengths to address the limitations of the other study. First, we will test both directions of the above-mentioned mediation model using daily diaries, completed by both parents and adolescents, conducted over a two-week period to measure work-family conflict, parent-adolescent conflict, parental work functioning, and adolescent psychosocial functioning. Second, we will test the same theoretical model using a laboratory design. Specifically, we will recruit family dyads with one full-time working parent and one adolescent for a laboratory study. We will randomly assign each full-time working parent and adolescent dyad to one of three levels of the independent variable: (a) task induction of parental work stress and a low-stress condition for the adolescent, (b) task induction of adolescent psychosocial stress and a low-stress condition for the parent, and (c) both parent and adolescent assigned to a low-stress condition. Next, we will administer a controlled task meant to reflect parent-adolescent conflict (i.e., mediator variable), and we will objectively assess parent and adolescent physiological flexibility (i.e., an index of emotional dysregulation) during this task. We then will administer performance-based tasks of parental work functioning and adolescent psychosocial functioning to test the impact of parent-adolescent conflict on these domains, as well as the cross-domain, indirect impacts of parental work stress and adolescent psychosocial stress. The proposed project promises to improve our basic understanding of the spillover between parents? work experiences and non-work family life."

This project examines four important questions about social movements using<br/>combined and augmented data from two prior NSF-funded projects, the Dynamics of Collective<br/>Action project and the Political Organizations in the News project.<br/><br/>First, the project will compare social movement dynamics using data on protest events versus data on social movement organizations (SMOs) with the innovative dataset described above. Second, the project investigates how disruptive tactics affect news media coverage of social movements and social movement organizations by using data on protest events. Given the continued importance of the news media, better understanding the dynamics that drive media attention is an important question for social movement scholars. Third, the project assesses the extent to which protest and the news coverage of SMOs may influence public opinion trends over time. Specifically, we expect that specific types of movement events shape how favorably the movement is perceived, that this shifts over the lifespan of the movement and depends on political responses to the movement. Finally, our project will examine a key methodological issue of interest to researchers: Selection bias suggests that the news media cover only a portion of social life and do so in selective and structured manners. Our project will use data on protest events and SMOs to pinpoint the differences between selective reporting on protest events versus the selective reporting on SMOs. Quantitative analyses will rely on negative binomial models, ARMA models, multinomial logistic regressions, as well as time series analysis.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Understanding the dynamics that shape political participation in a democratic context is an issue of broad interest to the general public and policy makers alike. Similarly, furthering our understanding of media coverage and public opinion of political activism is important to a broad set of stakeholders.  Findings from this study may be of interest to policy analysts involved in monitoring domestic and international events and trends.  Broader impacts also include the creation of publically available dataset on domestic political activism since 1960 at a scale hitherto unknown.  In addition, methodological advances produced in the process of creating the data set, as well as those derived from analysis will be made available to the public. The project will also offer substantial research training to undergraduate and graduate students."

Although others have noted that a key feature of economic and social impacts on the environment is unevenness in the creation of and exposure to impacts, few have sought to evaluate the socially-structured factors that create and support such disproportionality.  Towards this end, this prjoect focuses on three research questions: 1) How has disproportionality in the production of pollution changed over time? 2) What drives changes over time in disproportionality in the production of pollution? 3) What factors account for the persistence of egregious polluters? This project will answer these questions by using both quantitative and qualitative comparative techniques that analyze facility-level emissions for over 600 establishments in the pulp and paper milling, printed circuit board manufacturing, and PVC pipe manufacturing industries in the U.S.   This inquiry offers a new framework within which to analyze the production of environmental harm, challenging several common assumptions; namely the notion that environmental harm is proportional to economic growth and that firms are disconnected decision-making units. In addition to theoretical and empirical insights, a disproportionality approach also has direct implications for the regulation of pollution.  Rather than setting absolute standards for an entire industry, a disproportionality approach focuses on identifying egregious polluters and enabling the reconfiguration of production among those who are the worst actors.  Improving the environmental performance of a select few egregious polluters can significantly reduce the pollution burden generated by an industry.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>The focus of this project is on facility pollution production metrics and socially-structured drivers of change over time.  The analyses will rely on US EPA's Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) data from 1988 to 2012 for three industry classifications: printed circuit board manufacturing (NAICS 334412), PVC pipe manufacturing (NAICS 326122), and pulp and paper milling (NAICS 3221).  To answer the first research question (assessing the temporal dimensions of disproportionality), TRI data will be used to calculate several annual measures of disproportionality (Gini coefficients, lower-tail inequality ratios, relative ranking scoring, and spatial techniques) within each case study industry, using both raw and size adjusted facility-level data.  To answer the second question (an assessment of the drivers of temporal changes in disproportionality in industrial pollution), analytical techniques such as regression and/or Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) will be used to to evaluate eight hypotheses, related to industry visibility, capital costs, contribution to GDP, offshoring, growth and decline, regulation, and niche-seeking behavior.  The dependent variable in this will be annual measures of disproportionality by industry and/or ranks of individual facilities within the disproportionality distribution, yielding a total of seventy-five observations of disproportionality over the twenty-five year study period. To answer the third research question (assessing the persistence of disproportionate patterns), two most polluting facilities will be selected, based on multi-year average, size-adjusted TRI data, from each case study industry.  The research team will then develop profiles of these six facilities, collecting data on operational characteristics, financial performance, characteristics of the communities in which they are located, interactions with regulators and the history of the facility within the community.  Data will be gathered both through archival sources and through on-site interviews with facility managers, representatives of local government, and community organizations.  Interviews will focus on the relationship between the facility and the local community.  The goal of these facility profiles is to analyze the socially-structured factors that allow for the persistence of egregious pollution."

Identity communication is defined as the methods that a person uses to convey his/her identity (Thatcher, Doucet, & Tuncel, 2001) and identity verification refers to the process of bringing others to confirm one's identity (Swann, 1983). The technology that facilitates communication in virtual teams can distort individual-level identities by heightening (Walther, 2008) or hiding (Weisband, 2002) them. The technology can thus create a social barrier to participation in virtual teams, negatively influencing a number of individual and group outcomes, including overall team success (Gomez, Huici, Seyle, & Swann, 2009). We adopt a mixed-methods research approach (Venkatesh, Brown, & Bala, 2013) to develop design guidelines for systems that improve identity communication and verification in virtual environments. Data will be collected in three phases, leveraging qualitative and quantitative techniques including interviews, surveys, and experiments.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project are in four key areas. First, our research will result in specific guidelines for designing information technology to support effective identity communication and verification in virtual environments. We will explain how the characteristics of various communication media influence identity communication and verification. Organizations can use this information not only during the onset of new virtual teams, but also as continuous improvement initiatives or when new members join an existing team. Second, we help organizations understand how to choose among different types and characteristics of communication technology to most effectively manage identity communication and verification. By understanding users' individual and task-related needs, organizations can deploy the best technologies to improve identity communication and verification given these specific characteristics. Third, with the increased use of online learning environments, we expect that the results of this work can be used to enhance both the teaching and learning experience by providing guidelines to enhance identity communication and verification in the educational context. For example, a common criticism of online learning experiences is that students do not feel a connection with their instructors or other students. Understanding how technology can enhance identity communication and verification can go a long way in helping us to develop effective online teaching tools. Fourth, a better understanding of identity communication and verification in virtual teams will have direct implications for NSF-sponsored virtual organizations, enhancing the effectiveness of cross-disciplinary and remote collaborations. Virtual teams offer a cost-effective and practical way to bring together diverse people from cross-disciplinary fields regardless of temporal or spatial restrictions; however, even face-to-face cross-disciplinary teams often experience communication difficulties (Oetzel, 2008), and these difficulties are generally exacerbated in virtual settings. By pointing the way toward more effective and sustainable virtual organizations, our research can thus strengthen the cyber-infrastructure for cross-disciplinary science and engineering research."

Scientific communities develop with a wide variety of talents and skills, harnessing the resources of multiple institutions, and tackling larger, more multifaceted problems.  The virtual research environment (a key type of cyberinfrastructure combining technologies for conducting research, analyzing data, coordinating projects, and enabling collaboration) has been shown to make significant contributions to the success of distributed science.  However, there are few systematic studies of the process by which these environments develop both through intentional design decisions negotiated among a diverse and changing set of stakeholders over an extended period of time and through unplanned events and contingencies.  <br/><br/>This project will advance and refine a theoretical framework for understanding the processes by which virtual research environments are developed and how these processes contribute to their effectiveness.  The framework proposes that virtual research environments are constructed through interactions among five critical activity tracks, specifically: (a) technological design and implementation, (b) scientific work, (c) the community of virtual research environment users, developers, funders and other stakeholders, (d) managerial and organizational system, and (e) critical events. The project will conduct in-depth longitudinal analyses of the sequences of events involved in the development of virtual research environments along the five tracks and trace inter-track influences.  It will assess the fit of various developmental models to identify factors that account for the development of the virtual research environments and the co-evolution of the tracks.  Finally, it will relate various features of the developmental process to effectiveness of virtual research environments in terms of productivity, collaboration, community development, and successful implementation and use of virtual research environment features.  <br/><br/>Results of this research will yield insights into how virtual research environments develop and change over time. The multidimensional model can be used to understand the conclusions drawn by previous case studies and to enable a more sophisticated analysis of cyberinfrastructure evolution that can identify key drivers and effectiveness.  The results also promise insights into other kinds of virtual organizations with multiple, complex sets of stakeholders. The project will advance process theory and research by providing a more complete specification of the types of relationships among process tracks and articulation of developmental models based on these relationships.  <br/><br/>Virtual research environments have great potential to advance scientific inquiry.  Understanding how they develop and how their effectiveness is related to their development over time would enable designers to improve the development process.  Knowledge of the various processes that promote or derail design, implementation, and use would increase the effectiveness of developers and managers of virtual research environments, and assure the best returns for public and private investments."

Therefore, both NSF and many business schools may be missing outstanding funded research projects because of these dynamics. To the extent that business schools could become more oriented toward grant funding in the future, the present workshop will be timely and helpful for both NSF and business schools. More importantly, if research funds can be leveraged further to bring stronger research to market, this is valuable to all constituents and stakeholders that could benefit from greater insights into issues that affect well-being of individuals, competitiveness of the workforce, innovativeness of research, partnerships between academia and industry, and increased economic competitiveness--all concerns of both business schools and NSF. Greater insight into, awareness of and ultimately better alignment of high value research resources at a national level could have transformative effects across the United States business school research markets in which NSF could play an increasingly key role as a sponsor and partner in the coming decades.<br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/><br/>The objective of the workshop is to conduct a needs assessment involving the unique challenges and opportunities that business schools specifically face in applying for and administering federal research grants. The workshop attendees will be sampled from college leadership at research-oriented colleges of business in the United States.  These leaders will discuss such issues as the barriers that prevent business faculty from pursuing research proposals and the challenges colleges of business face in supporting the acquisition and administration of grants; the unique strengths and assets that business schools possess that make them very competitive for doing outstanding research and for obtaining funding for that work; possible strategies and best practices to enhance and leverage opportunities for pursuing grants, while minimizing the challenges; and ideas for future business school-NSF coordination, communication and initiatives to enhance funded research activity that would benefit all relevant stakeholders. A white paper will document this workshop and will be disseminated. This will make a unique contribution because the match between business school research orientations and values important to NSF is potentially high: Business school research combines science and knowledge from many disciplines, including mathematics, economics, psychology, philosophy, sociology and others while applying increasingly rigorous methods and standards in research.  In addition, this research is conducted within a profession that values practical relevance to business and society.  Thus, business school research reflects high value on intellectual merit, the potential for multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary research, as well as value on broader impacts or contributing to the achievement of societally relevant outcomes.  Further, human capital market dynamics may result in top scholars from various disciplines being attracted to business schools resulting very active and influential researchers doing business-related research. Yet, despite potential for outstanding NSF-funded research, many business schools wrestle with unique challenges in scholarship, such as an emphasis on journal lists to evaluate research which may present difficulties for pursuing interdisciplinary research as well as a culture that does not promote the pursuit of research grants to support scholarship as is common in other disciplines."

Such routines are believed to be responsible for the efficiency advantages of organizations as structures for collective decision-making. Nevertheless, to date there has been little formal modeling or evidence collected as to how organizational routines emerge, endure and adapt to change. This project proposes an agenda for studying the emergence, maintenance, adaptability and optimality of organizational routines that combines game theoretic analysis with experimental evidence. The baseline model is a novel but simple ""harvesting game"" wherein teams of agents repeatedly harvest a grid over several periods with full information about all past choices. The team's goal is to uncover as many novel outcomes on the grid as possible in the time allowed but without the ability to communicate with one another. The absence of communication proxies for specialization by team members that makes communication difficult or for settings where communication is impractical, for example during an emergency response. In such environments there are easily identifiable optimal routines and this study examines both theoretically and experimentally which routines emerge, how long it takes them to emerge, whether they are stable once they emerge, and if agents make short-run sacrifices in the interest of promoting the emergence of optimal routines. <br/><br/>This research will build upon and extend the baseline model by studying routine formation in variants where 1) there is no information about past choices, 2) the complexity of the decision task is increased, 3) more players are added, 4) some players have private, payoff-relevant information that may naturally position them as team leaders and 5) players have the ability to communicate with one another prior to making their harvesting decisions. The new framework will broaden understanding of how members of organizations learn to form routines in a variety of different environments that are all amenable to theoretical and experimental evaluation. Thus will bring game-theoretic analysis and rigor to the organizational routine literature which to date has been studied using the methods of psychology and organizational behavior researchers. The game-theoretic framework allows one to assess the extent and source of deviations in routine formation from the rational choice ideal so that there is a better understanding of the role played by bounded rationality in routine formation. In addition, data on organizational routines are difficult to measure or observe -- the experimental tests proposed using the methods of experimental economics, where subjects earn payments based on their own choices and the choices of other members of their same team, provides an excellent framework in which to study organizational routines. The experimental designs, programs, data and findings resulting from this proposal will be made freely available so that other researchers can build upon the new framework and instructors can teach this new approach to organizational routines in the classroom."

When a single issue or objective crosses multiple independent units, collective action and coordination problems can arise from fragmented authority. Local sustainability is a broad and complex issue and provides an ideal lens through which to study these organizational challenges. Despite the widespread adoption of sustainability goals by local governments, an administrative apparatus to coordinate their implementation is lacking or inconsistent in many communities. This research examines the impact that different administrative arrangements have on policy efforts and outcomes and assesses the institutional structures necessary to facilitate the success of local sustainability efforts. Functional coordination and collective action problems within a single government are similar to institutional collective action problems that arise from fragmented governmental authority within metropolitan areas. In both cases, the connectedness of services, objectives, and resource systems produces positive and negative externalities. Resolution of these dilemmas requires additional resources and expertise, as well as the development of administrative structures to integrate decision-making. This work intends to initiate a general theory of institutional collective action that encompasses administrative dilemmas within as well as between organizations. It proceeds in two stages: First, it will collect quantitative data on administrative institutions via surveys administered to local government officials. Second, eight cities will be selected for in-depth analysis based on characterizations developed from their survey responses. An analytic narratives approach and social network analysis will be applied to explore the mechanisms available for overcoming functional collective action dilemmas in local sustainability. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>Although functional coordination has long been a concern within public administration, these issues are not emphasized in contemporary policy theories. Little is known about how the design of administrative mechanisms influences organizational ability to integrate decisions and resolve functional collective action problems. Even less is known about how administrative mechanisms affect policy outputs and outcomes at the organizational level. Through an exploration of city sustainability policy, this research will initiate a theory of functional collective action that extends institutional collective action research beyond its current focus on horizontal and vertical fragmentation among independent governments. Findings will provide insight to address the common problem of ""fuzzy boundaries,"" whereby the lack of clear lines of responsibility for tackling complex policy issues necessitates more coordinated efforts. This research will systemically identify the strengths and weaknesses associated with different mechanisms for overcoming functional collective action and enable municipalities to make more informed choices and minimize administrative dilemmas within as well as between organizations. The results of this analysis are expected to be of applied value to local government practitioners. Additionally, the empirical survey data collected from this research will contribute to the broader study of urban governance and policy in the US and enable researchers to better examine sustainability and local government administration questions."

However, knowledge sharing remains a problem for many large organizations. Sometimes, problems of knowledge sharing occur because the knowledge itself is sticky; it requires deep contextual understanding to decode and apply. Other times, knowledge is difficult to transfer because individuals do not have the correct intensity of relationships (strong or weak) for the type of knowledge that needs to be transferred (tacit or explicit) such that individuals are unwilling to take the time and make the effort to teach a colleague something they do not know. In other cases, the problem is much simpler: People within the organization don't know what other people in the organization know and are therefore unable to seek or share with them.<br/><br/>The goal of this study is to understand how new enterprise social media can help to improve at least two important aspects of knowledge sharing: Helping people find the knowledge they need and helping them to build the correct kinds of relationships necessary to transfer certain kinds of knowledge. As organizations spend money and time on the implementation of these new technologies in an attempt to increase worker productivity, it seems timely and important to understand not only if such tools can overcome perennial problems associated with effective knowledge sharing, but also to elucidate the mechanisms by which such technologies affect knowledge sharing practices. In short, this research stands to unveil what happens when organizational communications that were once private become public and the consequences that this communication visibility can have for the organization as a whole. This research has high-impact potential for education, labor, and business policies as it considers strategies for retooling and reshaping the communication environments of organizations that are becoming increasingly distributed."

This project examines four important questions about social movements using<br/>combined and augmented data from two prior NSF-funded projects, the Dynamics of Collective<br/>Action project and the Political Organizations in the News project.<br/><br/>First, the project will compare social movement dynamics using data on protest events versus data on social movement organizations (SMOs) with the innovative dataset described above. Second, the project investigates how disruptive tactics affect news media coverage of social movements and social movement organizations by using data on protest events. Given the continued importance of the news media, better understanding the dynamics that drive media attention is an important question for social movement scholars. Third, the project assesses the extent to which protest and the news coverage of SMOs may influence public opinion trends over time. Specifically, we expect that specific types of movement events shape how favorably the movement is perceived, that this shifts over the lifespan of the movement and depends on political responses to the movement. Finally, our project will examine a key methodological issue of interest to researchers: Selection bias suggests that the news media cover only a portion of social life and do so in selective and structured manners. Our project will use data on protest events and SMOs to pinpoint the differences between selective reporting on protest events versus the selective reporting on SMOs. Quantitative analyses will rely on negative binomial models, ARMA models, multinomial logistic regressions, as well as time series analysis.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Understanding the dynamics that shape political participation in a democratic context is an issue of broad interest to the general public and policy makers alike. Similarly, furthering our understanding of media coverage and public opinion of political activism is important to a broad set of stakeholders.  Findings from this study may be of interest to policy analysts involved in monitoring domestic and international events and trends.  Broader impacts also include the creation of publically available dataset on domestic political activism since 1960 at a scale hitherto unknown.  In addition, methodological advances produced in the process of creating the data set, as well as those derived from analysis will be made available to the public. The project will also offer substantial research training to undergraduate and graduate students."

The availability of confidential ethics hotlines (both telephone and web-based) increased dramatically with the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002.  However, apart from statistics on the prevalence of ethics hotlines in corporate America, little is known about the frequency and types of claims reported.  This study will involve organizing, categorizing, and analyzing data collected by a large provider of ethics hotline services, a database of more than 1,000,000 cases over a 10-year time frame. The PIs will test the impact of naturally occurring ethical and outcome primes on hotline reporting behavior.  In addition, they will develop an Ethics Index showing trends in the reporting of various ethical violations over time. They hypothesize that major business scandals and related events reported in the media should serve as primes to increase attention to ethical violations and result in significantly higher rates of wrongdoing reporting.  Additionally, the PIs will survey a sample of working professionals to explore how the mechanism of counterfactual priming may increase reporting of unethical actions in organizations.  <br/><br/>In terms of broader impacts, this research should improve understanding of how organizations can best use ethics hotlines to decrease unethical behavior. Detailed information will be obtained on the prevalence and nature of reported wrongdoings, and on the effects of contextual and management practices on reporting rates. The planned Ethics Index will be useful to practitioners who need to monitor relative prevalence of ethical behavior. The survey findings will yield theoretical and practical insight into management methods that are most likely to increase reporting of ethical violations.  In addition, this project will benefit from a newly developed ethics center through collaborative relationships developed among researchers, ethical compliance officers from organizations, and students interested in how to create more ethical organizations.  It is expected that this will enhance the speed of translation of research findings into effective practice."

Healthcare providers need a diverse range of information in order to protect themselves and the public. However, they may, or may not, be able to obtain such information from their employers. In critical and time sensitive situations, they may obtain information from other sources to complement employer-provided information. This research aims to study the dynamics on the types of  information healthcare providers wanted and obtained and their relationships with organizational network and structural characteristics. <br/><br/>This research is grounded in the literature on social network and organizational structure. It also builds on the principal investigators' previous productive collaboration on the health information wants (HIW) concept, framework, and questionnaire, which emphasizes a bottom-up approach to understanding the types and amount of a broad range of health information wanted by individuals. This study can advance knowledge about social network and organizational structure by examining their effects on healthcare providers in various healthcare organizations in time sensitive situations like the current Ebola crisis. It can also advance the HIW framework by examining its use in the context of healthcare organizations. It bridges together these two previously separated bodies of literature and creates new knowledge about the information healthcare providers wanted and obtained, as well as their relationships with social network and organizational structure. Study findings can help develop informational, educational interventions to effectively and efficiently provide the right types and amount of information healthcare providers in different organizations want in Ebola-like emergencies in the future. The findings may lead to improved health and well-being of healthcare providers and the patients they care for when similar crises occur."

TESS was established in 2001 and capitalizes on economies of scale to enable scholars from across the social sciences, on a competitive basis, to conduct ground-breaking research on issues of broad theoretical and practical importance. The intellectual merit of TESS is closely connected to its successes in enabling social scientists to collect original population-based experimental data in a timely manner; promoting better understanding of fundamental social, political and economic questions; maximizing financial efficiency by pooling expenses for otherwise separate studies; and offering mentoring and educational resources. The new initiatives extend educational aspects of TESS, broaden TESS' population of proposers, enable TESS to contribute to assessing the value of probability sampling for experimental inference, and enhance the review process to ensure the highest quality studies.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of TESS are wide-ranging. Since its inception, TESS has provided more than 400 social, behavioral, and economic researchers with the opportunity to conduct original experiments, testing a broad range of innovative hypotheses. Proposals are solicited on a continuous basis, undergo rigorous peer review, and involve Internet-based data collection with a representative national sample. The project provides an enormous gain in efficiency since costs of sampling, data collection, and data management are distributed across studies. To date, TESS has conducted over 270 population-based experiments, across disciplines including sociology, psychology, political science, communication, economics, judgment and decision making, law, public health, communication, psychiatry, and others.<br/><br/>By providing a common platform for population based experiments, TESS efficiently enables innovative scholars to identify causal dynamics that advance knowledge on topics such as investment behavior, judicial legitimacy, voting turnout, trust, and many more. TESS also facilitates methodological advances to topics such as the effects of web-tracking on survey response and the optimal ways to measure sensitive attitudes.<br/><br/>TESS promotes teaching, training, and learning at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Students regularly submit proposals, many of which are funded. Even when not funded, however, students receive detailed feedback on their research at the critical design stage. TESS broadens the participation of underrepresented groups, both as investigators and research participants. At the heart of TESS' mission is the democratization of access to high quality, original experimental data, thereby putting the power of population-based experiments in the hands of researchers from all backgrounds, all academic institutions, and all career stages. And because the TESS data collection platform involves a representative sample, the results of TESS projects reflect the broad diversity of the United States."

The future of work involves a virtual context for many occupations. Hence, two new challenges for LDP workers are to train leaders to perform effectively in a virtual context and to leverage future technology in their training of leaders. We address these challenges by proposing to create a leadership training platform to be used by LDP workers to train the next generation of diverse leaders to adapt to an online setting. The proposed platform leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) models to provide real-time feedback to leaders. An interactive dashboard including visualization and storytelling will be developed as the front-end to provide information on leaders? performance to improve their leadership signals. The proposed work will have practical implications for numerous stakeholders. First, LDP will be able to effectively train current and emerging leaders to work in the virtual setting. Second, future leaders and their followers will benefit from the improved training. Third, the approach aims to substantially reduce discrimination in leadership evaluations by creating objective and diverse training data.<br/><br/>The current scope of work within the award is focused on creating partnerships and further developing the proposed work. The award will support on-site and virtual meetings and observations of end users of the proposed AI platform (i.e., LDPs). A leadership and data science workshop will be held to share and develop ideas. LDPs will participate for training and networking purposes and to provide feedback. A consultant will be engaged to develop the project plan. Graduate students will assist in additional analytic model building and the creation of study materials for the project and subsequent data collections (e.g., developing the experimental protocol; creating recruitment and training materials).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the discussion on the role played by the intellectual capital of the workforce employed by entrepreneurial firms has been limited. Is it the case that the entrepreneurs that succeed are different in their stock of intellectual capital and these differences are manifested and rewarded by the market very early on, or is it that their early advantages and location choices enable them to navigate market imperfections and shocks that hinder less lucky establishments? In this project, we study how the skill-level of entrepreneurial firms in the United States has changed over the past decade particularly in response to competitive shocks. The proposed project can inform what types of entrepreneurs succeed, the specific role played by founders' human capital, and how shocks such as increased competition and technological changes affect entrepreneurial firm outcomes. <br/><br/>To understand the drivers of the stock of intellectual capital in entrepreneurial firms, we will assemble a longitudinal database on the skill profiles of entrepreneurial firms. The data will be sourced from establishment level micro-data from a panel of large-scale surveys conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the skills of employees of start-ups and incumbent firms in over 800 occupations in U.S. over 2005-2013. Using over 10 million establishment-occupation level observations, we will address three primary research questions. First, we will identify the change in the composition of skills of entrants over this period, and factors that are associated with these changes. Second, we will identify environmental shocks and their effects on the intellectual capital and competitiveness of entrepreneurial firms. Finally, we will examine the long-term consequences of founding intellectual capital on firms' subsequent intellectual capital and other outcomes."

Although we know that cultural contexts shape how people perceive and use technologies, technologies that facilitate coordination and collaboration across national boundaries seem to demand that workers use the technologies in compatible, if not similar ways. The goal of our study is to build theory of how people appropriate a technology in different cultural contexts and how different ways of appropriating a technology affect collaboration across national boundaries. <br/><br/>The research pivots on a quantitative and qualitative longitudinal field study of a knowledge sharing system in close collaboration with an architecture and design firm that is designing and deploying a knowledge sharing system across 17 locations in 10 countries. We will interview and observe workers in three countries as they use this new knowledge sharing system. In six additional locations we will also use diaries, surveys and digital traces automatically generated by the system to document usage patterns and workers' evolving attitudes toward and appropriation of the technology. The project will advance our understanding of the possibilities and problems that arise when deploying collaboration technology for global use.  It will extend knowledge of how work practices, particularly those intertwined with technology use, converge or diverge when workers span national boundaries and cultural contexts.  It will also advance our understanding of and, therefore, enable theory development about the factors that promote convergence or divergence of use and how these are interwoven with differences in cultural expectations about and understandings of productivity and client satisfaction. <br/><br/>Little is currently known about how to best structure and manage globally distributed work. The default has generally been to impose ""best practices"" across locations, but this has met with limited success because ""best"" does not necessarily translate across cultural contexts.

Smart meters capture data on household energy usage at frequent intervals and transmit those data to utility companies, who use the data to automate meter reading and billing, detect and respond to outages, and manage grid operations. Data collected over time can be used to forecast demand, understand customer behavior and develop new service and pricing plans.  In the long run, these data can drive forecasting and control models that allow utilities to respond rapidly to fluctuations in power demand with compensatory load control strategies. This capability can reduce the magnitude of peak demand, thereby reducing both infrastructure costs and the consumption of fossil fuels that power peak generation facilities. Despite these advantages, smart meter data also appear to create powerful customer privacy concerns that may inhibit the adoption of smart meter technology by utilities. To address privacy concerns pertaining to the smart meter data, this project proposes three studies: Study 1 uses public data on electricity usage to develop a set of privacy scenarios that will be tested in focus groups to explore consumer privacy concerns. Study 2 involves a quasi-experiment to assess key dimensions of the scenarios and help identify which scenario has the highest level of acceptability to consumers. Study 3 involves one-on-one discussions with utility company representatives to develop a toolbox of communication methods and content that balance consumers' privacy concerns with the goals and constraints of utilities. <br/><br/>The current theoretical model of privacy and technology, based on an information boundary framework, posits that consumers' willingness to share private information is rooted in the nature of the relationship with the party with whom the information is shared. Although a number of researchers have applied this information boundary framework to intra-organizational situations, the framework has not been tested in the context of smart meter data privacy. In the proposed sequence of three studies, this project gathers data from informants with the intention of understanding whether the information boundary framework is applicable to examining the relationships between consumers and regulated monopolies. The proposed project provides insights into public attitudes and concerns, as well as industry practices and policies regarding privacy of smart meter data. Through direct interaction with utility companies, as well as dissemination at industry conferences, in trade journals and through the media, the researchers will share their findings with practitioners, regulators and others who can create solutions that give customers confidence about the protection of their data."

Today, electrical utilities in the U.S. face a challenging future, marked by the need to modernize an inefficient, deteriorating infrastructure based on obsolete technology, and public resistance to location of new generation and transmission facilities. Smart grid technologies have the potential to reduce the environmental impacts of electricity generation and distribution while improving the quality, reliability and efficiency of electricity supply.  The smart grid would allow utilities to better manage supply and demand, while giving customers real-time information and the ability to adjust consumption in response to pricing. A smarter grid also is necessary to incorporate clean, but intermittent, energy sources such as solar and wind power on a large scale. Yet this innovation presents major organizational and technical challenges to utilities, which operate in a highly-regulated environment. New knowledge is needed on organizational innovation in response to important but potentially disruptive technologies in the context of a regulated monopoly. A new model of organizational adoption of innovation will be developed and tested, contributing to the fields of organizational science, innovation studies, information systems, public policy, and management. The research will provide useful knowledge and insights for managers, regulators and policymakers involved in smart grid adoption and implementation.<br/><br/>The research addresses the following questions: (1) What internal and external factors determine the motivation and willingness of utility companies to develop and deploy smart grid innovations?  (2) How do organizations in a regulated environment respond to innovation opportunities and challenges? (3) What policy changes would be required to overcome obstacles to the adoption of socially desirable innovations?<br/><br/>These questions will be addressed through a combination of qualitative case study and quantitative survey work.  Comparative case studies will be carried out on utilities that differ in important organizational characteristics and operate in different state regulatory regimes in order to analyze the impacts of organizational and environmental factors on smart grid adoption. Based on findings from the case studies, and on a set of individual interviews paired with web surveys, a large survey of U.S. utility companies will be developed to test hypotheses about the factors influencing smart grid adoption and implementation.<br/><br/>The creation of a smart electricity grid has the potential to reduce the environmental impacts of electricity production and use, improve the reliability and security of the nation's electricity supply, and create a platform for new business and technology development. The proposed study will provide insights into the changes that need to occur before a cleaner, more reliable and intelligent electrical infrastructure can be put in place. These insights will provide guidance for utility companies, their suppliers and customers, and also policy makers and regulators.

A myriad of reasons for low female participation in engineering have been investigated, such as pay and promotion opportunities and family-related constraints. Attention has also been given to the role of workplace discrimination, as women in STEM experience discrimination at higher rates than women in non-STEM disciplines. However, few researchers have focused their attention on how the day-to-day experiences of women in engineering might facilitate or impede discriminatory behavior. While many of the existing studies on workplace discrimination have focused on the individual or the organization, we argue that teams play an overlooked role in women's experiences in engineering. Taking a team-centric approach, we examine interpersonal discrimination and its multi-level ripple impact on both individual and team outcomes. <br/><br/>The current project is designed to complete three high-level objectives. Our first objective is to identify whether and how engineering team experiences differ by gender, specifically in relation to team discrimination. As a second objective, we will examine the effect team discrimination has on engineering team outcomes (e.g., performance, creativity). Finally, our third objective is to examine the impact team discrimination has on individual-level outcomes and specifically the career trajectory of female engineers. To effectively carry out the stated objectives, we will use complementary methods to conduct two primary studies. We will begin with a multilevel, longitudinal examination of discrimination in STEM teams, specifically in relation to female team members. This first study will address the concern regarding a lack of longitudinal, team-level data and provide insight regarding an understudied phenomenon, team discrimination. We follow with an experience sampling study examining team discrimination toward females working within the STEM field and the effects of such occurrences throughout their daily lives and long-term career aspirations and decisions. The culmination of this program will provide a greater understanding of how team experiences shape the career path for women in STEM, with the overall goal of retaining women in STEM careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The study leverages a unique natural experiment that enables the first direct empirical comparison of the multi-decade evolution of two functionally identical systems, developed separately under different organizational structures. Although significant prior research has examined both the fit between technical and organizational architectures, and the implications of different technical architectures for system lifecycle properties, the question of how technical-organizational ""fit"" can drive desirable design outcomes remains unexplored. To answer this question, rich process data on the sequence of events, actions and decisions that describe the parallel development processes will be collected. The data includes (1) in-depth interviews with each of the key contributors, (2) proposals and progress reports written on a near annual basis, (3) design documents, (4) press releases and (5) journal articles capturing key outcomes. The data will be analyzed using a process tracing approach, enabling a link to the underlying mechanisms driving each design decision to the structure of the context of the corresponding technical and organizational architectures.   <br/><br/>If successful, the insights from this work have the potential to be transformative in that they will characterize organizational configuration as a new design lever; this could enable engineering organizations to harness research outputs more effectively and influence the structure of the technology they produce. In addition, this work has direct implications for current space policy debates on the role of centralized investment in technology development and industrial policy. In that context, prior work by the PI has been presented, at the request of executive-level officials, at both the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). More broadly, on-the-ground scientific data, on the actual design process, in real design organization, is the foundation for a revolution in the science of design engineering. These insights could yield advances in innovation productivity that will substantially accelerate the national (and global) economy."

Millions of dollars are spent in the public and private sectors to support research collaborations among scientists who possess the breadth and depth of expertise to address these complex problems. An increasingly prevalent approach to integrating diverse expertise is the use of interdisciplinary science teams. Although interdisciplinary scientific collaboration has many success stories, it is also true that in many cases these teams fail to successfully integrating the knowledge needed to address a problem. The goal of knowledge integration among diverse scientists is often elusive due to the make-up of the teams, lack of understanding about best practices for managing collaborations, and team leaders who are scientific experts but have not been trained to lead diverse teams of professionals. The consequence can be a costly investment in scientific endeavors that do not reap the expected benefits. It is critical that interdisciplinary science teams have the capability to collaborate and integrate their knowledge. A team's integrative capacity is a core competence necessary for these teams to perform successfully. Integrative capacity is a capability that is sustained through an interactive system linking social, psychological, and cognitive processes and emergent states in the team that can provide them with the resources needed to succeed. This research investigates how the development of a team's integrative capacity and subsequent knowledge outcomes are impacted by: (1) boundary-spanning leadership behaviors and (2) communication structuring interventions. Exposure to these interventions can nurture team members' trans-disciplinary intellectual orientation, the enduring values, beliefs, skills, and behaviors that support collaboration with teammates who have diverse disciplinary backgrounds, which in turn fosters the development of integrative capacity. <br/><br/>Broader Impact. Given the reliance of society on interdisciplinary science teams for advancement in key areas such as medicine, education, security, and technology, the development of theoretical and practical knowledge about how to build and maintain integrative capacity in these teams is imperative. This research directly supports the aims of the SciSIP program and the NSF by investigating the structures, processes, and interventions that facilitate the development of usable knowledge by interdisciplinary science teams. First, this study sheds light on how leader and communication interventions can enhance a team's integrative capacity and team members' trans-disciplinary intellectual orientation, both of which can support teams working across boundaries to generate new solutions to complex problems. Second, training material and digital metrics developed in this research can be leveraged to foster improved scientific collaboration in teams beyond those included in this study. The insights gained from this research can foster improved scientific collaboration and the resulting scientific breakthroughs that are the promise of interdisciplinary science teams."

If the disruption is minor, like a flat tire, recovery is easy. If the disruption is major, recovery may be more difficult. For example, the shutdowns caused by the COVID pandemic forced doctors, nurses, and other clinical staff to find new ways to care for their patients.  This research will  use this example to study the effects of disruptions on healthcare routines. The expectation is that routines will ?bounce back? from minor disruptions, but the effects of major disruptions are more difficult to predict. After major disruptions, some routines may return to normal, while others may not.   <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to discover basic mechanisms that influence stability and change in routines.  To understand what makes some routines stronger than others, the effects of the COVID pandemic will be studied in four medical fields at the University of Rochester Medical Center: dermatology, orthopedics, oncology, and cardiology.  Data from electronic health records will be used to study the effects of shutdowns and other kinds of disruptions, such as changes in software and billing codes. Tools from network science will be used to model routines as patterns of action. These methods will allow comparisons to be made between patterns of action before and after a disruption with great precision. The extent to which the strength of a routine depends on the structure of the action pattern itself will be examined.  Data will be produced on outpatient clinical routines during the COVID-19 pandemic along with  a variety of materials to communicate the findings with a broader audience. Ultimately, this research will lead to a better understanding of how institutional routines can be made more reliable and effective in the face of disasters large and small.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ventures like this are outliers because they are rare and have disproportionate impact at multiple levels. Moreover, these outlier ventures are very different in both their inputs and outcomes than what most would characterize as typical. The project's framework will enhance knowledge of how organizational systems grow, improve performance, and achieve outlier outcomes over time in changing competitive environments. Because this framework is built on data from multiple complex social systems, it is generalizable for and capable of improving the outcomes of individuals, teams, firms, industries, and nations. <br/><br/>The overarching research focus of this project is to identify the primary drivers of outlier outcomes in entrepreneurship. Building a theory about the emergence of outliers is difficult under the assumption of normal, bell-shaped distributions of inputs and outcomes. Under the normal distribution assumption, outliers are usually cleansed from the analysis-either deleted or mathematically transformed-to reduce their influence. This project moves beyond the normal distribution assumption and uses theoretical assumptions and methods from complexity science. This theoretical approach has two advantages. First, a complexity perspective assumes that in relatively unconstrained environments, outcomes will likely be distributed according to a power law. This distribution is vital because traditional theory building and testing methods assume that the probability of an extreme event is effectively zero. A power law assumption can more adequately reflect the empirical distributions found in studies of emerging ventures. Second, a complexity perspective suggests that a system's outcomes are primarily the result of an interconnected combinations of inputs, including 1) an agent's initial endowment of resources, 2) the agent's rules for engagement with other agents based on expectations for future outcomes, and 3) the quantity and quality of environmental resources. Within this perspective, the emergence of a system from non-existence to existence occurs as a nonlinear, threshold-based process. This project uses non-parametric maximum-likelihood bootstrap estimates of power law fit on representative samples of nascent entrepreneurial ventures to derive a meta-construct framework of inputs that apply to all organizational forms: endowments, expectations, engagement, and environments. Then, to test this generalizable 4E framework, these inputs are used to build an agent-based simulation model, the outcomes for which will be validated with empirical data from the fastest growing privately held firms."

Such a feature is not restricted to ""cyberinfrastructures"" but is part of a much more general, but still only poorly understood, social phenomena highlighted by press accounts of the democratizing and/or exploitative power of the Internet.  This project explores the nature and effects of such public participation on contemporary organizations.  The goal is to determine which kinds of participation are most beneficial for innovation and legitimation, as well as what kinds of threats participation might pose, and for whom.  To address these questions, the project will collect and analyze a large number of ethnographic case studies, using an innovative software environment for collaborative qualitative research.<br/> <br/>The project poses three questions:  1. How does the ontogeny of a virtual organization affect conceptions and practices of participation?  2. How do new socio-technical systems (e.g. the Internet) transform participation in Science, Technology Engineering and Medicine (STEM) over time?  3. What is the relationship between the quality of participation and the quality of resource creation, curation and re-use?   The research uses and extends a database of over 110 rich case studies of participation, and a software tool for evaluating participation across multiple cases.  For question 1 we add new detail to these case studies, based on themes that have emerged from previous research; for question 2 we add cases of pre-Internet forms of participation, to explore more precisely the effects of technological change; and for question 3 we explore a new set of cases that focus on data as a valuable resource."

It asks questions such as: when and why are NGOs created, and for what purposes?  Despite the practical and theoretical importance of non-governmental organizations, scholars have given little systematic attention to when NGOs are founded and the purposes for which NGOs are created. This project combines theory from multiple disciplines to enhance knowledge of organizational creation, examining NGOs over time and across different sectors. The proposed project offers two key advances. Methodologically, the project employs experimental and qualitative methods to complement traditional observational, quantitative approaches to organizational creation. Theoretically, the project examines mission content and innovation in NGO creation, building on previous work to examine new outcome variables. The proposed research involves three principal types of original data collection and analysis. First, a statistical analysis of coded NGO mission statements will enable the study of dynamics among a large number of real-world INGOs, promoting external validity. Second, a survey of NGO practitioners will enhance the study's internal validity by integrating an experimental component. Moreover, it will enable the testing of the individual-level observable implications of the theoretical framework. And third, qualitative case studies of the evolution of several INGO sectors will explore the processes by which sectors develop and change. This multi-pronged research strategy is guided by a recognition that the study of organizations benefits from analyses at multiple levels and using multiple methodologies. Cutting across all prongs of the research design is a commitment to studying NGOs in diverse sectors of activity to promote the study's generalizability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Knowledge generated from this award offers insights for organizational science and for workforce diversity and performance.<br/><br/>Experiences that threaten one?s resources contribute to negative organizational outcomes. When threats are tied to an identity (e.g., race), they can lead to inequality and further group disparities. Racial identity threats occur in multiple forms, ranging from environmental (e.g., mega-threats: negative, large-scale, diversity-related episodes that receive significant media attention) to interpersonal (e.g., microaggressions: daily verbal or behavioral indignities that denigrate individuals from racial minority groups). The role that organizations play in supporting employee resilience?continued behavioral and psychological goal pursuit despite adversity?to racial identity threats is unknown. Thus, this project identifies the organizational proactive resources (continually available resources present before a threat, e.g., race-based employee resource groups) and protective resources (resources made available after a threat that are meant to diminish strain responses, e.g., paid therapy) that shape key psychological mechanisms that predict employee resilience: identity safety (i.e., feeling like one?s identity will not evoke harm) and emotional exhaustion (i.e., feelings of being emotionally drained).

Digital technologies have substantially changed the landscape of the industry, with online delivery becoming an essential revenue source for restaurants. Delivery platforms collect customer orders via a mobile app and have drivers pick up the food and deliver it to customers. These platforms, however, have had an uneasy partnership with restaurants. Delivery platforms possess strong power over independent restaurants and set platform fees as high as 30% to extract most of the surplus created on their platforms. Although there are heated debates on whether and how to regulate delivery platforms, the lack of empirical studies hinders the progress towards effective policymaking. This project investigates the impact of delivery platforms on restaurants and the implications for policymakers. The findings from this project advance our knowledge on how on-demand platforms and other powerful platforms create value for businesses, organizations, and our society. This project also enhances our knowledge about how to regulate powerful platforms.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project has three objectives: 1) Investigating the Realities of On-Demand Delivery. Whether restaurants benefit from delivery platforms, or what types of restaurants are more likely to benefit (e.g., independent vs. chain) are fundamental questions of importance to restaurant owners and policymakers; 2) Investigating the Effectiveness of Current Regulatory Policies. More than a dozen of cities and states have recently imposed regulations that cap the commissions that delivery platforms can charge. This project investigates if such regulatory policies are effective, and the promises and perils of implementing such regulations; 3) Designing Optimal Regulatory Policies. Building on the findings from 1) and 2), this project seeks to design optimal regulatory policies that improve total social welfare, balancing restaurant revenue, consumer surplus, and the sustainability of the on-demand delivery business.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although there have been some studies of organizational efficiency in businesses, few have studied organizational efficiency in the public and non-governmental sectors---sectors that are becoming increasingly large shares of modern economies.  This research will use a unique field experiment, involving a large donor organization and over 800 recipient community organizations, to study the efficiency in large, multitiered and complex organizations with emphasis on how information flowing through the organization is used, and how to effectively incentivize agents to achieve the organization's goals.  This research will seek to answer three major questions: (i) can a transparent self-reporting tool and non-monetary incentive scheme motivate community organizations to achieve their goals; (ii) how do parts of a large complex organization respond to and use new information they receive; and (iii) how does the response to new information depend on the characteristics of the organization? The results of this research will lead to improvement in the performance of large, complex organizations generally.  Efficiency in these organizations will improve the performance of economies worldwide. <br/><br/>Large organizations face challenges in managing information, setting incentives and delegating decision-making power to the relevant personnel. Existing empirical work investigate incentive problems in private organizations. However, limited attention has been paid to the performance of large non-profit and government organizations. This project will use a unique field experiment to address three issues---information and communication within organizations, divergent preferences within organizations, and performance of non-government organizations. The experimental design will allow the PIs to test three main ideas: (i) Can community organizations be incentivized through self-reporting and non-financial rewards to improve their performance; (ii) How does each part of a large, complex organization respond to new information on performance indicators; (iii) Do the responses of management and workers to the receipt of new information and incentives depend on organizational characteristics of the organization, communication costs between parts of the organization, and decentralization of decision making authority?  To answer the first question, over 800 recipient community organizations will be surveyed and then randomized into different self-reporting schemes using a two-by-two factorial design with controls.  This design allows the PIs to test for the impact of self-reporting on service delivery or governance. To answer the second and third questions, the PIs will carry out a novel revealed-preference ranking experiment involving both junior and senior management staff members. The results of this research will strengthen our understanding of the determinants of efficiency in organizations and in the process, contribute to increased efficiency of economies worldwide."

Despite their importance, prior research has paid limited attention to the nonwork domain, including family, community, and personal life, contexts that are antecedents and consequences of leadership role occupancy, leadership development, and day-to-day variation of leadership behaviors. This project takes a life-span and holistic approach to analyze how nonwork domain variables, such as community involvement and volunteering activities, lead to and are shaped by leadership role occupancy. Further, the project provides critical insights on how nonwork domain experiences might promote leadership development and how leadership development might contribute to leaders? growth and thriving in other nonwork domains. Lastly, the project will help to uncover how and when leaders? day-to-day behaviors and their nonwork domain experiences mutually influence each other. These findings will inform business organizations seeking to promote leadership to facilitate their economic competitiveness, and will also inform society regarding how leadership in one context may contribute to the welfare of organizations more generally.<br/><br/>We know very little regarding how leadership in one organizational context may influence leadership and work behavior more generally, or the reciprocal relationships between leadership in multiple domains.  Adopting a multi-method approach, this project will conduct three empirical studies. First, the project will use archival data (National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, NLSY) collected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (NLSY 79, NLSY 79 Children and Young Adults, and NLSY 97) to examine how individuals? nonwork experiences and their leadership role occupancy at work influence each other reciprocally. The project will use mixture latent Markov modeling to capture and predict the leadership role transition patterns. Second, the project will use a longitudinal design collecting multi-wave, multi-source data to examine the interplay between leaders? nonwork experiences and their leadership development processes using latent change score models.  The third study takes a within-person perspective and analyzes how leaders? work and nonwork experiences and behaviors are interconnected on a daily basis. The project will conduct an experience sampling study over 10 consecutive days, capturing fluctuations of leaders? work and nonwork behaviors and experiences that are otherwise missed by surveys separated by longer time intervals; it will use dynamic structural equation modeling (DSEM) in data analysis. Lastly, by triangulating findings of three studies using different methods, the project will promote a more comprehensive understanding of how leaders? work and nonwork experience affect each other across different time frames and life stages.  Findings from the project will inform organizational theories regarding leadership, as well as life course perspectives that focus on the interplay between work and non-work domains, especially regarding leadership.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Generativity refers to an overall capacity to produce unprompted change driven by a large, varied, and uncoordinated audience, as seen in digital ecosystems such as Apple, Youtube, Android and Wordpress. In such ecosystems, most innovations are accomplished by third-party individuals who often go beyond the design intent of the original innovators. Using data from highly generative innovation contexts, the researchers seek to understand how combinations of existing technological components that act as genetic elements (i.e., genotypes) can give birth to the incredibly rich and dynamic varieties at the product level (i.e., phenotypes). Each individual innovation is characterized as a co-expression of a certain set of existing components (referred to as ""technology genes"") in the similar way system biologists characterize the structure and dynamics of cell behaviors though a co-expression network of genes. Furthermore, the ways in which mutations in technology genes can cause changes in the co-expression network, which in turn causes changes in the behavior of the digital product is explored. <br/><br/>Such evolutionary analysis of generative innovations ultimately allows an understanding of how distributed organizations can produce generative innovations without a traditional organizational structure that centrally governs and coordinates innovation activities. More specifically, the research contributes to the organization literature by developing new evolutionary model of organization design for innovations and to the open innovation literature by showing the structural and dynamic patterns of open innovations through interactions among third-party developers. Additional important methodological contributions are in the advancement of an analytical approach to analyze big data to understand complex and multi-level, socio-technical phenomenon.<br/><br/>Although digital artifacts from open ecosystems have become an important part of the economy, very little is known about the generativity of such artifacts. Understanding the mechanisms of generativity can empower organizations in several ways: first, they can become more innovative by using existing artifacts to design new digital artifacts; second, it can help organizations create innovation opportunities based on effective exploitation of digital platform that prompts uncoordinated interactions among heterogeneous and distributed innovators; and finally, understanding generativity can not only help organizations in product design and innovation, but also in related contexts such as viral marketing. These findings will be of interest not only to firms and innovators, but also to policy makers and the media as well."

However, despite scientific data inputs, modeling is heavily influenced by social and political factors. This is especially true in the management of our most pressing environmental problems, in which there are many diverse actors and conflicting values and interests. Through in-depth analysis of international water quality management organizations, this project addresses the process of how models are made and how this process can be improved through better ?model governance? ? the rules and processes adopted within an organization to shape individual and group actions around how models are developed and used. Better understanding of model governance will improve how science is used in environmental policies. The project is developing workshop materials for practitioners, as well as novel undergraduate and K12 experiences to link the fields of environmental science and policy.<br/><br/>The project?s overall objective is to build a quantitative meta-model that can predict future states of a scientific model. The project is identifying the parameters, conditions, and processes that how actors and governance structures shape model development. The overall objective is supported by three interconnected activities: (1) systems dynamics modeling, (2) comparative case study, and (3) education, outreach, and engagement that will inform future iterations of the meta-model. The project is solidifying an integrative theory of model governance, comprising both a qualitative framework and quantitative operationalization. Improved computer model governance will transform understanding of science-based environmental policy, including building public trust in computer models and reducing uncertainty that is created by social and political factors embedded in models. The quantitative meta-model will create a key link for modular social-ecological systems modeling: that of how the knowledge embedded in the computer models that organizations use for decision-making is updated in an iterative and adaptive way.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Like many organizations in the private sector, state courts have begun to look closely at the potential for integrating AI technologies into their operations. There are many ways in which AI might improve court operations and enhance the courts? services to the public, including improving caseflow management, interfacing with court users and helping them navigate court systems, or aiding substantive legal decision making to improve case outcomes. However, the stakes involved in implementing new AI technologies in this sector are also high; courts have duties to safeguard the constitutional rights of court users, and the decisions they make can be life-altering. These high stakes make it vital that courts are involved in the selection and development of these technologies from the ground up. This project aims to contribute to the science of organizations by examining the effects of organizational and team attributes on AI integration potential. It also generates new knowledge and resources for the state courts: an interactive tool that visualizes multi-layered network models of the state court workforce and reports and resources that provide actionable guidance related to AI implementation in the courts. In the long run, facilitating the successful integration of AI into the state courts through organizational research has the potential to increase access to the courts for court users, make court workforces more diverse and employment outcomes more equitable, increase efficiency in case processing, and bolster public trust and confidence in the courts.<br/><br/>This three-year project brings researchers and court professionals together to 1) map the state court workforce using a multiteam systems approach and 2) identify points in the court workflow where AI integration might be more beneficial or detrimental to the courts? organizational goals. First, the project team uses an extensive workforce survey and social network analysis to map the court workforce and the roles of individuals and teams within it. The researchers examine the structure of the workforce; interrelations among different workers, tasks, activities, and skills; impacts of individual workers on the caseflow process; and workers? perspectives on the potential roles of AI in their work. Second, the project team uses these network models to predict potential impacts of AI at different points in the caseflow process. The researchers also identify AI applications with the greatest potential to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of these job-holders, promote job satisfaction and well-being, and align with the goals and purposes of the state courts in society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Organizations are increasingly adopting vulnerability disclosure programs (VDPs) as a key strategy for managing and mitigating cybersecurity risk. These programs crowdsource security work?they invite independent security researchers to report newly identified software bugs. Yet, the adoption and management of these programs is rarely simple or straightforward. They can create new points of stress and complication within organization. This project examines how these programs work and, importantly, how they can be improved. Protecting digital networks, devices, and software is a key national priority. Ultimately, the research project?s insights will help organizations improve their security.<br/><br/>While organizations have long relied on a blend of in-house information technology expertise and contracted computer services, VDPs are a different approach to harnessing expertise. This project uncovers the ongoing intra-organizational work required to integrate these new intuitional models of software review within organizations; and it assesses the ultimate effectiveness of VDPs to improve organizational cybersecurity. Specifically, the project addresses two related research questions: (i) What forms of institutional work are needed to create and sustain VDPs?; (ii) How effective are VDPs at improving security? To answer these questions, the project creates and analyzes a novel set of qualitative and quantitative data drawn from select ongoing VDPs. Collected data includes anonymized program data, administrative data, and interviews with staff associated with managing VDPs. This project provides a window into: (i) how new cybersecurity practices are adopted, maintained, and transformed by and within organizations; and (ii) the efficacy of VDPs to improve organizational cybersecurity. Answering these questions will provide insight into larger organizational dimensions of cybersecurity and the efficacy of VDPs to improve security outcomes.

However, it also assumes local communities can either develop new organizational capacities or divert resources away from more traditional services and activities. This project aims to develop a better understanding of the processes through which local governments identify sustainability goals, find the resources needed to achieve them, and assess their performance. This requires a flexible research design to observe communities in both urban and rural contexts which fall along the entire spectrum of sustainability: those attempting to formulate long-term sustainability strategies; those attempting to develop the capacities needed for implementation; and those attempting to track their progress and adapt.<br/><br/>This research will assess the integration of sustainability planning, capacity-building, and performance management in Indiana municipalities. Each of these elements alone represent a complex system in which external and internal factors interact to influence organizational processes, routines and decisions. However, these systems also interact, reinforcing or destabilizing broader patterns of organizational behavior through feedback. The empirical context and timing of the project is critical as these systems are still infantile and evolving. Three phases of mixed-methods and longitudinal research designs will be used over five years: first, strategic planning will be analyzed through automated text-analysis; second, surveys and interviews will be used to assess capacity-building and implementation; and third, case studies and experiments will examine performance management and adjustment. The project will build infrastructure for future research by developing a comprehensive database of variables generated across the three phases.

Three extremes include a) millions of employees now working remotely (telecommuting), b) millions more furloughed, laid off, or suddenly unemployed, and c) a third group of ?essential employees? continuing to work in public at great risk to their own health. Such rapid changes in the structure of individual work conditions have led to unique challenges and pressures for these three groups. Further, the divisions of employees into each of the aforementioned groups may exacerbate societal disadvantages already noted in science and practice, including socioeconomic status (SES) and race because these divisions are seen in the types of jobs that allow for (or mandate) continued work through social distancing requirements instituted by federal and state governments. Thus, the current project will examine how such rapid changes in work structure and status have differentially affected employees across various levels of job structure, SES, and race. The researchers will examine (1) how these changes affect employee outcomes (including job attitudes, health and wellbeing, and job performance), and (2) the ways in which organizational responses to COVID-19 helped to mitigate (or exacerbate) these outcomes. This study seeks to advance the field of organizational science by uncovering the ways in which continued changes in occupational structure and organizational responses interact to influence employees over time. Further, this project will provide information used to potentially develop recommendations for organizational and government policy regarding best practices in handling societal-level crises of this magnitude in the future.<br/> <br/>The primary objectives of this project are to (1) empirically examine how rapid changes in work conditions due to COVID-19 have differentially affected workers across various levels of job structure, SES, and race, and (2) examine how organizational responses to COVID-19 have affected the relationship between such job changes and employee well-being. By collecting survey and open-response data from employees (and those unemployed) across four months, we aim to examine how job structure changes affect job-related attitudes and behavior and well-being.

The project will enhance basic understanding about when, why, and how entrepreneurs make strategic decisions to enter the non-profit market, and the consequences of these choices for social welfare outcomes.  The project will have a broader impact by assisting current and potential non-profit leaders to make better decisions regarding when and how to create new organizations. The research from this project will be disseminated through targeted publications, a public website, and a workshop. The study will also contribute to education and research infrastructure. Specifically, it will develop datasets about NGOs based in the United States that will be made available to other researchers, including extensive qualitative materials from several NGO sectors. It will have an important educational benefit by training undergraduate and graduate students and generating classroom resources.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop and test theory about variation in NGO creation and mission content.  It asks questions such as: when and why are NGOs created, and for what purposes?  Despite the practical and theoretical importance of non-governmental organizations, scholars have given little systematic attention to when NGOs are founded and the purposes for which NGOs are created. This project combines theory from multiple disciplines to enhance knowledge of organizational creation, examining NGOs over time and across different sectors. The proposed project offers two key advances. Methodologically, the project employs experimental and qualitative methods to complement traditional observational, quantitative approaches to organizational creation. Theoretically, the project examines mission content and innovation in NGO creation, building on previous work to examine new outcome variables. The proposed research involves three principal types of original data collection and analysis. First, a statistical analysis of coded NGO mission statements will enable the study of dynamics among a large number of real-world INGOs, promoting external validity. Second, a survey of NGO practitioners will enhance the study's internal validity by integrating an experimental component. Moreover, it will enable the testing of the individual-level observable implications of the theoretical framework. And third, qualitative case studies of the evolution of several INGO sectors will explore the processes by which sectors develop and change. This multi-pronged research strategy is guided by a recognition that the study of organizations benefits from analyses at multiple levels and using multiple methodologies. Cutting across all prongs of the research design is a commitment to studying NGOs in diverse sectors of activity to promote the study's generalizability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite widespread recognition of the need for effective and accessible learning opportunities for adult Americans, the nation is without shared scientific or policy goals for serving this vast population and lacks protocols for the cross-sector collaborative activity this service requires. The project fills this gap, with special foci on educational opportunities related to STEM careers and on working learners served by community colleges. STEM education and pathways into STEM-related occupations are the target domains of the entire endeavor. <br/><br/>The project outcomes include the specification of (a) a taxonomy of the kinds of people and life circumstances that comprise the broad category of working learners, (b) applied research goals whose pursuit will serve to improve the educational and occupational success of working learners, and (c) templates for cross-sector sharing of data, expertise, and infrastructure to pursue this applied research. Attendees will meet virtually as a whole on four consecutive Wednesdays in July. Outputs include a portfolio of policy briefs outlining a vision for applied research in such domains as: building a taxonomy of working learners; framing a learning science for specifically for adults; building the social science of academic progress and credential returns for working learners; dynamics of evaluation, hiring and retention of adults seeking employment through alternative pathways; envisioning a data infrastructure to observe the careers of working learners; and serving working learners in community colleges. The portfolio of policy briefs will be disseminated to the general public via a dedicated web page and presentations. The NSF IUSE:EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.

However, the COVID-19 crisis has drastically changed how teams collaborate, including periods of extended remote work, mixed remote and in-person teams, blurred home and work boundaries, elevated stress and anxiety, and extreme uncertainty about the future. The swift onset of the crisis required individuals, teams, and organizations to abruptly adapt to rapidly changing circumstances with little to no preparation. The proposed research will investigate disruptions to teamwork and how teams adapt during the COVID-19 crisis and in the ensuing recovery period. The project will investigate 30 real-world teams over a three-month period while in the midst of the crisis and for an additional one-month follow-up as events unfold. The goal is to understand how teams respond to changing contexts, how teams support each other, how conflict is managed, and how teams develop, adapt, and sustain the rhythms of teamwork during COVID-19 and in the ensuing recovery period. This foundational research will be essential to help organizations establish team structures and collaborative processes that enable them to more successfully address disruptions in the current and in future crises. The project will provide unique opportunities for interdisciplinary training of students in computer science and psychology, will broaden participation by recruiting diverse students, and will share a rich and unique dataset with the broad scientific community.<br/> <br/>The specific aims are to: (1) understand states, processes, and behaviors (e.g., team cohesion, communication patterns, collective stress) of teams during the COVID-19 crisis with a focus on factors associated with team performance; (2) investigate how individuals and teams experience and adapt to major COVID-related life events, such as school closings, enforcing of social distancing, budget cuts, illnesses, and so on; and (3) identify patterns in team states and behaviors over time, detect disruptions to these patterns, and study how new patterns emerge during the crisis and in the ensuing period of recovery. The project will use wearable sensors to track heart rate, sleep, physical activity, and relative location (home or away), communication tools (e.g., team calendars, email metadata), ecological momentary assessments (EMAs), validated survey instruments, and semi-structured interviews to investigate team states, team processes, team behaviors, and team performances in context and over time.

Studies of crises show that human communities differ significantly in their responses; a crisis presents individual organizations and communities of organizations with a common problem, yet solutions may be elusive. This project will advance basic knowledge about the effectiveness of organizational recovery in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic crisis. The project will help organizations and managers to better understand the conditions under which organizations responding to a crisis of unprecedented magnitude may recover more effectively. Results will equip organizations and managers with knowledge and skills about how to choose strategic responses to crisis, by highlighting the insights derived from study conditions. In collaboration with the University of Florida Entrepreneurship and Innovation Center, the project will disseminate results to business and scientific communities by providing free-of-charge webinars that explain to managers and researchers the strategic responses that can help organizations, particularly small-and-medium sized enterprises, to more effectively recover from the current crisis. Project findings and activities will help to ensure the economic competitiveness of the United States and promote our nation's safety and security.   <br/> <br/>When crises occur, business organizations need to move strategically to recover, but leaders and managers may be unclear as to which actions to take. The project will provide prescriptive theoretical directions for the development of processes and actions toward effective recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic crisis. The project will classify, explain, and evaluate organizations? strategic responses to the current crisis for effective recovery and answer three research questions: First, among the multiple paths toward organizational recovery, which ones are more effective? Second, what organizational and environmental factors are most conducive to effective recovery? Third, would dynamic adaptation (e.g., switching resource allocation from the organization?s own rebuilding to community-based self-organizing efforts, and vice versa) be effective for recovery? Interview data will be used to inform, validate and improve a computational model designed to explain and evaluate the effectiveness of strategic responses of organizations. The project will use this model to compare a wide range of variation in responses, and probe the conditions under which certain responses could be more effective for organizational recovery. The project will produce: (1) a multi-level taxonomy of strategic responses to crisis for organizational recovery and (2) an explanation and evaluation of strategic responses to crisis for effective recovery. Using a mixed-method approach, the project will not only corroborate a computational model with interview data, but also use the model to extend understanding beyond case observations.

While most studies pursue only one aspect at a time, focusing on either diversity or unity, this project moves beyond a single-edged approach to study the diversity-unity paradox in a systematic, integrative manner. By introducing the concept of ?unified diversity? to capture an organization?s capacity to elicit diverse viewpoints and perspectives while simultaneously sustaining its oneness, this project aims to clarify the construct space of unified diversity, develop an integrative research model, and identify possible management practices for enhancing unified diversity. By doing so, this project sheds light on how to harmonize diversity and unity in organizations. The outcomes of this research hold significant promise for guiding individuals, organizations, and broader societal entities in harnessing unified diversity to enhance learning and performance.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to investigate how organizations can leverage ?unified diversity? to enhance learning and performance through human resource management. The project is structured in three key phases. The first phase involves conducting qualitative interviews and surveys to establish a clear conceptualization of unified diversity. In the second phase, the project employs computational modeling and quantitative surveys to examine the antecedents and outcomes of unified diversity, seeking to clarify organizational dynamics that lead to and result from unified diversity. The third phase integrates qualitative interviews, computational modeling, and quantitative survey studies to pinpoint effective management practices and organizational designs that promote unified diversity. By adopting a mixed-methods approach, this project enriches current knowledge about the nature of the diversity-unity paradox and the micro-foundations of unified diversity, which is essential for advancing organizational learning and maintaining a competitive edge in the contemporary business landscape.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A single patient will see many doctors and other care providers over the course of pre- and postoperative care. The surgery itself also involves multiple surgeons and other caregivers.  The relationships that develop as physicians work together during the surgical care process create teamwork networks that have important implications for the quality and efficiency of care. This research will observe and interview physicians, nurses, and other caregivers about their work and the treatment decisions that they make around inpatient surgical procedures. This information will be used to systematically examine how collaborative networks evolve and change in hospitals. This research will inform efforts to improve the quality and reduce the costs of surgical care while providing new insights into important social science questions about how these kinds of networks form and grow.<br/><br/>In the last two decades social scientific research on networks has undergone a dramatic transformation as new data and methods have enabled a shift toward dynamic analysis. At the same time, work in the fields of organizational theory, economic, and cultural sociology has emphasized the contingent and situational nature of relationships, structures, and their effects. While networks of various sorts have been shown to influence individual and collective outcomes in a wide range of substantive areas, the linkages between micro network dynamics, macro network structures, and their effects have yet to be fully specified. This research will take important steps toward explaining the formation and effects of a substantively important class of networks by examining the ways in which organizational arrangements, individual choices, and existing relationships shape physicians' treatment decisions and ultimately the health of larger patient populations in individual hospitals and broader healthcare markets. This mechanism-based approach to understanding how physician relationships form, reproduce, and change in particular organizations and treatment situations integrates work on the collective dynamics of large-scale networks with theories that emphasize the organizational and institutional contexts in which relationships emerge, gain meaning, and exert their effects.  The theoretically anchored, observational, and interview-based field work that we propose herein seeks to clarify the complicated processes by which networks evolve while identifying specific mechanisms, scope conditions, and contingencies that span individual preferences, structural pressures, and organizational constraints or opportunities."

Team development interventions (TDIs) refer to tools, trainings, and resources intended to support teamwork competency development, and have enhanced team effectiveness by helping teams coordinate and collaborate to maximize team productivity and reduce errors. Yet, many organizational strategies for implementing TDIs often resemble a shotgun approach: if we provide enough TDIs to enough people, covering enough broad information, everyone should eventually be able to engage in better teamwork. At a basic level, this strategy can address fundamental skills. However, individuals and teams may be getting only a small piece of what is useful for their particular needs. Instead, organizations need better tools to periodically assess team functioning in order to identify what and when TDIs teams truly need to improve their functioning in a timely manner. This can extend critically limited organizational resources, and can empower teams to handle their specific challenges more efficiently, maximizing the use of resources for societal benefit. Thus, we aim to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the design and delivery of TDIs, focusing on research that will enable a better way to pinpoint teamwork needs. <br/><br/>To advance our knowledge and practice of TDIs, this research leverages a profile-centric approach via the investigation of teamwork state profiles. Such profiles holistically identify groupings or categories of teams based upon where they fall on a set of relevant functional/dysfunctional factors. We aim to move beyond traditional variable-centric teamwork approaches through empirically demonstrating that profiles more holistically represent the interactions of different teamwork factors over time, providing more meaningful guidance as to which TDIs may be most needed to improve or maintain teamwork. The application of profiles to a teamwork context is innovative, with enormous potential for research and education alike. A mixed-method series of four studies will be used to achieve the overall research and educational goals. In these studies, we will systematically advance teamwork science by applying novel methods for identifying, interpreting, and monitoring teamwork profiles, in order to subsequently assess and develop educational resources and tools for a more appropriate path to selecting TDIs. These studies will be conducted in field settings, moving from archival exploratory analytic techniques to discern key teamwork factors and profiles, to the systematic, quantitative evaluation of propositions surrounding the value of profiles for enhancing team effectiveness and TDIs. We test our ideas in the context of two disciplines critical to society, healthcare and engineering, in order to discern: 1) the efficacy of a profile approach to teamwork in different organizational settings; 2) the multi-level characteristics influencing profile emergence; 3) the value of using profiles as a predictor of team effectiveness; and 4) the validity of using profiles to better match TDIs for desired outcomes. Leveraging these two contextual domains further, this work will enable us to educate beyond one audience; findings will be integrated with and applied to the enduring education and training practices of multiple audiences of healthcare employees, medical students/residents, and engineering students preparing to enter their respective fields."

The purpose of this research is to evaluate the interrelationships between social and cognitive processes in team meetings for generating a creative idea or product. The project will assess the team cognitive process sequences that effectively result in more creative ideas, the effect of team dynamics on these cognitive processes, and how cognitive and social processes interact to produce creative outcomes. We will further investigate whether an intervention to facilitate team creativity will improve creativity and the effect it has on both cognitive and social processes.<br/><br/>To address these aims, two studies will be conducted. The first study will be a laboratory study, where teams will be ad-hoc, one-time meetings. These will be short-term teams that have no previous interaction. The laboratory conditions will allow for audio and video recording of the team interactions, which facilitates detailed and nuanced analysis of both cognitive and social processes. The laboratory study will also allow us to test an intervention using debriefs to facilitate reflection that fosters team reflexivity. Building on the findings from this initial study, our second study will recruit semester-long undergraduate teams in engineering design courses at University of Nebraska Lincoln (UNL) and Clemson. These teams work to develop a product or idea based on real client demands, for a semester long project.

Of course, people might hold views or make choices independent of their ties to other members in the same group or organization.  Alternatively, individuals might share views with their peers.  In this latter case, shared perspectives may simply reflect classic homophily (aka selection bias), or true peer influence channeled by the new network ties developed with peers.

A primary reason for this is a lack of understanding of the value of formal, computational approaches and a lack of training in computational modeling strategies. This lack of appreciation and training is particularly true at the intersection of psychology and organizational science, which includes the disciplines of industrial-organizational psychology and organizational behavior. The workshop at the Ohio University brings together an international group of scholars from several sub-disciplines of psychology and organizational science to highlight the value and training a new set of scholars in computational modeling methodology. <br/><br/>Technical Description <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the project arises from a series of presentations by computational modelers of difference types that will focus on the value of computational modeling for addressing specific phenomena and for facilitating the construction of a cumulative science focused on understanding human behavior at work. That is, computational modeling provides researchers with the means to explore dynamic psychological and contextual concepts mathematically and with simulations, including information regarding what study designs can be used to investigate the causal theories properly. Moreover, quantitative modeling techniques provide a vehicle for integrating levels of theory ranging from neurological to macro processes (e.g., economic activity). The broader impact of this project will be achieved via training of a cadre of new computational modelers and the publication of an edited collection of the papers presented by the established modelers and newly trained modelers. That is, as part of the training element of the workshop the trainees will develop and evaluate new computational models of specific phenomena. The best of these models will be submitted to journals for special issue consideration on computational modeling."

However, developing and implementing strategy typically requires many members of both upper and middle management to communicate and shape strategy through formal (top-down) and/or informal (lateral, upward) processes of influence. Unfortunately, the patterns of communication and informal influence that often arise among upper- and middle-level management groups can pose problems for strategic effectiveness. Such leadership failures are common, costly, and cannot be addressed without a better understanding of who will lead and who will follow in the upper layers of organizations. Although prior research has examined the characteristics of top executives to understand firm effectiveness, scholars agree that how top managers and middle-level managers need to interact to propel their firms toward greater success remains a ?black box'. This project delves into this black box by advancing and testing new theory related to the multilevel causes and consequences of the networked patterns of leadership and communication processes that emerge in the upper levels of organizations. By studying the complex dynamics inherent in the leadership of large organizations, this project directly and positively impacts each participating organization as well as the aggregate economy that relies on these organizations. <br/><br/>This project leverages partnerships with the Center for Creative Leadership (CCL) and the Gutierrez Energy Management Institute (GEMI) in order to conduct survey- and interview-based research with upper- and middle-level managers from approximately 50-75 organizations from a variety of industries (Study 1) and approximately 25 organizations within the Energy Industry -- an industry that is vital to national interests (Study 2). As a recruitment incentive, our research team is providing tailored feedback for each participating organization in the form of an hour-long virtual debrief presentation and personalized report delivered to senior executives. To maximize internal validity, field study results are being combined with a large-scale controlled laboratory experiment manipulating the drivers of leadership and communication networks in hierarchical multi-group systems (Study 3). Therefore, this research program connects micro-, meso-, and macro-level organizational theories and corresponding research methods in order to address critical and unanswered questions related to the drivers and outcomes of informal leadership and communication networks in the upper levels of organizations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An explosion of research in this area over the last 30 years has produced an understanding of how networks operate in equilibrium conditions based on dyadic features like balance, homophily, and exchange. Yet we still do not understand the effects of individual agency and contextual factors like organizational activity.  The purpose of this project is to develop and test a theory of network structuring and development based on the activities of human agents influencing one another within group contexts.  This project makes four contributions: (1) modeling network nodes as agents with their own motives and networking tendencies, (2) describing the influence of focused activities on network development, (3) accounting for the influence of organizational structures and work units on network development, and (4) explaining network dynamics as the product of a loop of structure and behavior which influences one another over time.  Understanding these phenomena will enable better design of a wide range of organizations, as well as better prediction and mitigation of organizational failure.<br/><br/>The theoretical context of this work is Network Reticulation Theory (NRT).  This theory draws-together elements of structuration theory and activity focus theory to explain how perceived network relationships are activated by triggers in an organizational system, for example how a deadline in a software engineering firm activates certain elements of an organizational network to produce a hackathon, potentially strengthening the constituent network relationships in the process.  We study this process using a unique dataset comprising ubiquitous observation of a software engineering shop, from which data about perceived relationships, observed communication, task activities, and member perceptions are recorded for 79 employees over a period of three years.  To evaluate the theory, we employ three complimentary methods: (1) A direct test on the empirical data using statistical relational event modeling; (2) a multi-agent social-network simulation that faithfully models NRT by capturing activation, reticulation, and enactment processes; and (3) a cognitive multi-agent social-network simulation that adds architecture for decision making at the network nodes.  The project also utilizes a novel method for identifying network connections from audio recordings that offers a useful supplement to sociometric badges."

The project-based nature of the construction industry introduces many challenges, one of which is the collaboration process among key participants and their contracting organizations. This challenge is magnified in sustainable building projects where interdisciplinary collaboration is most needed. Accordingly, the project examines the introduction and use of integrated project delivery (IPD) in project teams as an innovation in the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. As an initial step, case studies are used to follow conventional theoretical models that consider the innovation's match to the organizations' structure, climate, and values. Then key communication behaviors of inter-organizational project team members, who not only serve as conduits in information flow and champions of working together, but also are creators of meaning and influencers of others' attitudes, will be examined. Consequently, the study will explore communication behaviors related to team dynamics, negotiation, and role change and their relationship to commitment to IPD and project outcomes across 20 inter-organizational project teams engaged in sustainable buildings projects.<br/><br/>The long-term goal is to develop an integrated organizational communication model for industry that fosters collaborative long-term relationships, product quality, and innovativeness. This research represents an important, continuing step toward enhancing sustainable building practices via effective coordination mechanisms and at the broader level, the identification of communication behaviors central to inter-organizational project teams. Results will contribute to interdisciplinary teaching modules and be widely disseminated. The research outcomes will be used to inspire graduate students; especially women in interdisciplinary research via CrossTalks to be given at Michigan State University."

Workplace ostracism occurs when an organizational member is excluded or ignored by other people at work. Almost 70% of American employees have experienced workplace ostracism. The situation is worse among employees with a racial minority background, posing a tremendous challenge for organizational leaders who strive to promote an inclusive workplace in an increasingly diverse environment. This project investigates how employees respond emotionally and physiologically to workplace ostracism and the extent to which their racial background and cognitive attribution affect this process. Furthermore, the researchers determine the beneficial effects of relationship crafting, a proactive social behavior that helps ostracized employees to regain social connections, recover wellbeing, and restore performance. Findings of this project have important implications for policy and practice to improve diversity and inclusion in the workplace.<br/><br/>Using a multi-method approach, this project conducts three studies. First, using a vignette-based experimental study, the investigators examine the main and interaction effects of workplace ostracism and cognitive attributions on the victims? emotional strains. Second, employing a battery of laboratory tasks (Cyberball Game, Gift Card Task, and Trier Social Stress Test) and physiological measures (skin conductance level and heart rate variability), the investigators examine the distinct activities of sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system and the function of relationship crafting among ostracized individuals. Third, using the experience sampling method to collect multi-source data in a 10-week period, the investigators examine the fluctuations of workplace ostracism and employee responses that are otherwise missed by a between-subject design. Data is analyzed using multilevel modeling, Monte Carlo based confidence intervals, and multiple-group path analysis. Using a full-cycle design, the investigators ascertain the internal and external validities of the studies and develop a robust theory on workplace ostracism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The concerns about health care service advertising are founded on the notion that health care is fundamentally different from other commodities or services and thus the conventional, market-based distribution of the limited resources can be problematic. Also raised are the issues related to information asymmetry between health care service providers and the public. Advocates of a market-based health economy, on the other hand, argue that advertising helps health service consumers by bringing down prices and increasing choices. However, little empirical evidence exists to support or rebuke the claims purported by either side. It is also unclear what degrees of concern or ambivalence exists among health care professionals about the advertisements and how much, if any, health care service marketers are aware of the tension. Research on consumers' health care service advertising literacy is scarce, although they are often directly targeted by the advertisements for highly technical and often very costly services. This research will enhance health care marketing education and practice by generating concrete knowledge and evidence. In addition, the current study will lay a groundwork for health care service consumer education by gauging public understanding of the advertising messages. Ultimately, this research will illuminate how health care service advertisements can be deployed to spur healthy competition without wasting health care resources and compromising the doctor-patient relationship, and thus contribute to the enhanced wellbeing of individuals and communities.<br/><br/>In examining the content of health care service advertisements and perceptions and attitudes of the stakeholders, this research employs positioning theory, a framework for analyzing strategic communication of organizations, to better understand the relationships among the positions taken by the stakeholders, the messages conveyed through the advertisements, and the narratives about the relationship between the medical profession and society. The proposed study has three objectives: 1) To systematically analyze the content of health care service advertisements to capture a comprehensive and accurate picture of current health care service advertising practices; 2) To map and assess the positions of physicians, consumers, and health care marketers regarding the practices, aims, responsibilities, and ethical issues unique to the advertisements; 3) To advance positioning theory as an analytical framework for the strategic communication of organizations. To meet the objectives, content analysis of health care service advertisements, surveys of physicians and health care marketers, and a consumer focus group will be conducted.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is transformative, interdisciplinary, research that enables more effective design and implementation of community-driven cyberinsrastructure that will create an interoperable system of data systems and data types that serve a broad and disparate community of geoscience users with different backgrounds, needs, and scientific cultures.  The research will also pioneer new social and behavioral science theory, methods, and analytics that address new and emerging ways that stakeholders are aligned around big, complex, infrastructure projects.  The research is transformative in nature because it is a first-of-its kind project in which a major NSF community-driven infrastructure project of this magnitude has incorporated, as an integral part of its project structure, social science and an analysis of the community/stakeholder building process.  It also breaks new ground in the developing of quantitative approaches to measure the evolution of collective community and individual perceptions over time. This type of understanding is critical when building trust and partnerships between science and technology communities that rarely, if ever, interact.  The project involves the intimate interaction of social scientists, geoscientists, and cyberinfrastructure and computer science experts, with the results of the stakeholder studies being used to help improve the cyberinfrastructure design-and-build process, as well as guide the formation of the organizational and governance structures that will be needed to effectively manage community engagement and implementation of the final system. This research employs novel visualization tools and will develop innovative quantitative means for assessing stakeholder agreement and its evolution over time. The analysis of data and results will assist in identifing the most effective targets for infrastructure investment and understanding and improving community engagement in the design process, thus ensuring that whatever is created adequately serves end-user needs. Broader impacts of the work include the training of PhD students, accelerating progress in large NSF-initiated science and technology projects, and generating insights that will inform policy, planning, and resource allocation."

This can harm women?s career advancement, pay, and contribution to the workforce. To address this issue and facilitate women?s success in the workforce, it is necessary to understand why and when women speak up in work teams. This project explores potential barriers to women speaking up in work teams including social and psychological consequences, as well the key role social anxiety may play in exacerbating these negative experiences. This project directly and positively impacts participants, their organizations, and the overall workforce by creating clear suggestions on how to facilitate women?s participation in work teams, and ultimately increase their career success.<br/> <br/>This project fosters an understanding of why women are less likely to speak up and emerge as leaders in work teams by testing potential mechanisms across two studies. Study 1 is a two-week field study of approximately 150 employed adults using experience sampling methodology, capturing daily anticipated and actual experiences with speaking in work teams as well as their psychosocial consequences. Study 2 takes a more granular focus, using an observational laboratory study in which approximately 125 teams come together for one-time meetings. During these meetings, audio and video recordings of interactions and individual heartrate variability, galvanic skin response, and respiration rate are recorded. By studying the momentary physiological changes leading up to, and following speaking in a team, this study teases apart stress processes, cognitive processing, and their resolutions. Overall, this research project evaluates the how the experience of speaking up in work teams differentially unfolds over moments and days for men versus women, and the role social anxiety plays in this process.

The partnerships can take many forms including philanthropy, cause marketing, brand certification, and collective impact arrangements. Through communication, the contours of the partnership are made known to different stakeholder groups thereby influencing attitudes, intention to purchase, intention to donate, and intention to engage in activism. The research examines both activists and consumers' reactions to a variety of messages about corporate-NGO partnerships by using a series of three on-line experiments to map both consumers and activists' mental models of corporations and NGOs. This project fulfills three important objectives: (1) to further our understanding of the impact of communicated NGO-corporate partnerships on consumers and activists' attitudes, intention to purchase, intention to donate, and intention to engage in activism, (2) to understand the ways that such messages might overcome initially incongruent pairings through the inclusion of or exclusion of certain message characteristics, and (3) to understand how the different forms of NGO-corporate partnership may moderate these relationships.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this project is three-fold. First, it contributes to the study of semantic networks by investigating factors that shape how individuals' mental models evolve to incorporate new information. Second, this project extends previous marketing research on brand pairings to include a broader spectrum of social issues, stakeholders beyond consumers (i.e., activists), and multiple types of NGO-corporate partnerships. Third, it contributes to a broad-based understanding of the network of NGO-corporate partnerships through its testing of theoretically driven propositions.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This research offers three broader impacts for educational, policy and industry sectors. First, the project advances social science and computer science interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation by bringing together undergraduate and graduate student researchers. As such, it aims to train a new generation of students in scientific methods. Second, the findings will illuminate why some nonprofits are less likely to be supported by public funding thus allowing policymakers to make informed decisions about which social issues could be turned over to private funding sources and which will continue to need taxpayer support. Third, as companies seek to improve relationships with consumers and limit risk exposure from activists, the findings will offer industry leaders information regarding how communication influences stakeholders support of partnerships."

Thus, there is a critical need to identify pathways through which employees can achieve work effectiveness and wellbeing, despite facing difficulties. Work resilience -- positive adaptation despite adversity at work -- is an advantageous tool that offers a path to success despite adverse experiences. We propose one unexplored way to increase resilience is through recovery, in which non-work time is used to recuperate from fatigue and negative mood built up during the work day. This project's goal is to understand how psychological (e.g., detachment from work, relaxation) and physical (e.g., sleep, exercise) recovery experiences relate to work resilience. Determining behaviors that improve resilience which are under individuals' control during their non-work time has the potential to benefit individuals, teams, and organizations across every occupation. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to uncover and model the dynamic interrelationship of psychological and physical work recovery experiences with work resilience. This project: 1) assesses potential psychological (fatigue) and physiological (heart rate variability) mechanisms that link work recovery and resilience; 2) examines the differential effects of alternative work recovery experiences (i.e., psychological and physical) on work resilience; and 3) delineates the temporal dynamics between work recovery and resilience, uncovering potential cumulative and reciprocal effects. We will conduct two experience sampling research studies using (a) a sample of traditionally employed participants who work during standard weekly business hours and (b) a sample of shift workers - employees who work alternative shifts that at least partially fall outside the daytime shift range (e.g., night shift and rotating shift employees) - to test the current model. Each study is a four-week daily survey study in a sample of 100 working adults that incorporates both objective behavioral and physiological indicators. By explicating the relative importance of different recovery experiences contributing to work resilience and the dynamic relationship between work recovery and resilience, this project could provide a theoretical foundation to enhance organizational effectiveness and employee wellbeing despite unavoidable adversities. Findings will be shared with research outlets, business practitioners, policy makers, and community members.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This displacement--being torn from physical possessions, familiar surroundings and community--generates acute demands for connectivity, communication and connectedness. The displaced must navigate their connectivity and information needs while experiencing two types of mobility. First, they face macro-mobility as they leave their homes and communities in search of safety and shelter. Next, they must contend with resituated micro-mobility. As they work to establish and maintain ties within their new location, whether a refugee camp or temporary shelter.<br/><br/>These mobilities, as well as the physical environment of the displaced, create challenges for successful implementation of wireless networks, applications and devices. Moreover, displacement also creates extreme resource scarcity, dependency, geographic change and conflicts between individuals and organizations, further challenging information technology implementation and use. This situation demand robust and rapidly deployable network technologies, together with the applications to support victims in their time of need. It also calls for novel social science theories, providing a deeper understanding of the information requirements of the displaced along with informing technical development.<br/><br/>This award supports a workshop to generate relevant novel technologies and theories, and to define a research agenda derived from insights from a variety of scientific disciplines, namely computer, information, organization and geographic information sciences, as well as communication and refugee studies. The workshop will also include practitioners, particularly those working with refugees and displaced populations. Outcomes of the workshop will include a research agenda, with implications for academic research in wireless network architectures, information service design, geospatial visualization, community self-organization and international organization governance. An additional outcome will include publicly available multimedia use-case studies, designed to focus discussions during the workshop but also for subsequent educational use.<br/><br/>To assemble this diverse group, the workshop will be held in advance of the ACM DEV and ICTD2013 conferences at the University of Cape Town, South Africa in December 2013. This location allows the organizers to draw upon the diverse scientific expertise present at these two conferences. It also enables them to tap into local expertise developed as South Africa has and continues to host refugees fleeing conflicts in many parts of the continent. In particular, the organizers will invite officials from the field office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Cape Town Refugee Center.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/><br/>The workshop will generate a research agenda for technologies and social science theories to support the diverse forms of mobility and their effects as experienced by displaced persons. Together, the technologies and theories must overcome challenges including limited access to power and network infrastructure, dense settlements, rapidly changing geography, and new and changing social relations among individuals and between individuals and organizations. The research agenda will prioritize technical developments and their associated social scientific implications to meet the most pressing information needs, generating innovations for both organizations and individuals.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/><br/>The technologies and theories resulting from these efforts will potentially enhance the lives of tens of millions of displaced persons. In addition to making their lives easier, the application of technologies and social theories may also enhance their resiliency, thereby making recovery faster and more complete, limiting the overall negative impacts of armed conflict and disasters. The interdisciplinary nature of the resulting project teams will foster cross-fertilization between computer and information sciences and social sciences.

Nevertheless, the cost of household water and sanitation services for U.S. consumers has risen much faster than the general cost of living in the 21st century. Nonpayment of water bills is increasing and water utilities in some cities have responded by shutting off water delivery to households with unpaid bills. This project will identify the historical, ecological, demographic, technological, political, and legal factors that contribute to water unaffordability, and assess the consequences of escalating water costs for vulnerable populations. The project will show how a city?s organizational capacity, e.g., fiscal and economic resources, formal policies, physical infrastructure, information system resources, and the skill and professional training of city employees, affects the design and implementation of city policies on water affordability.  The project will also illustrate the extent to which certain types of policies and practices disproportionately affect elderly, disabled, low-income, and non-white Americans. The project will help government officials identify forces that create variations in water affordability policies, and will also develop educational materials to facilitate partnerships between municipal officials, water utility managers, and the public, to help them improve local water affordability and assistance programs.  <br/> <br/>The costs of household water and sanitation services has risen sharply in the 21st century, and nonpayment of water bills has affected some households. The study uses mixed methods and a comparative case study design to understand how a municipality?s organizational capacity and discretion among water resource managers interact with state-level legal and economic factors to shape decisions about cost relief policies for low-income, non-white, and other socially vulnerable groups, and enforcement mechanisms that secure payment of water and sanitation bills.  The project will first collect administrative and archival data on water policies in a sample of 12 cities in 2 states: Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.  Next, the project will select 6-8 cities for semi-structured, in-depth interviews, with 9-10 interviews in each city, for a total of approximately 80 interviews.  The comparative case study design, which nests municipal decision making in the context of state-level legal, political, and economic constraints, will advance research on sustainability that focuses on how place-based dynamics contribute to sustainable and just management of human needs and ecological resources. The project will advance sociological theories on organizational capacity and organizational learning by showing how public sector organizations integrate multiple types of knowledge--technical, bureaucratic, and ethical--in developing policies that facilitate or constrain access to basic human needs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This can harm women?s career advancement, pay, and contribution to the workforce. To address this issue and facilitate women?s success in the workforce, it is necessary to understand why and when women speak up in work teams. This project explores potential barriers to women speaking up in work teams including social and psychological consequences, as well the key role social anxiety may play in exacerbating these negative experiences. This project directly and positively impacts participants, their organizations, and the overall workforce by creating clear suggestions on how to facilitate women?s participation in work teams, and ultimately increase their career success.<br/> <br/>This project fosters an understanding of why women are less likely to speak up and emerge as leaders in work teams by testing potential mechanisms across two studies. Study 1 is a two-week field study of approximately 150 employed adults using experience sampling methodology, capturing daily anticipated and actual experiences with speaking in work teams as well as their psychosocial consequences. Study 2 takes a more granular focus, using an observational laboratory study in which approximately 125 teams come together for one-time meetings. During these meetings, audio and video recordings of interactions and individual heartrate variability, galvanic skin response, and respiration rate are recorded. By studying the momentary physiological changes leading up to, and following speaking in a team, this study teases apart stress processes, cognitive processing, and their resolutions. Overall, this research project evaluates the how the experience of speaking up in work teams differentially unfolds over moments and days for men versus women, and the role social anxiety plays in this process.

Although organizational structures compartmentalized according to specific expertise can produce efficiencies, this fragmentation becomes problematic when governments attempt to address complex problems that transcend multiple units. Urban sustainability is an exemplar of issues which cut across numerous responsibilities traditionally held by distinct units within a single government organization. This research examines the relationship between municipal governments? administrative arrangements, their policy adoption and implementation choices, and sustainability outcomes. It highlights the role of lead unit cross-functional authority?which we define as the clout that an initiative?s administrative lead has over other relevant units in the city government?and assesses its impact on local sustainability outcomes. In so doing, this research contributes to an evidence-based understanding of how public organizations function in order to enhance their design, management, and overall effectiveness.<br/><br/>This work advances convergence research drawing from organizational, policy, sustainable urban systems, and network science to increase the precision and robustness of the Functional Collective Action (FCA) framework. It provides important insight into the determinants of lead agency cross-functional authority?which extant research has highlighted as fundamental but inadequately operationalized?and its influence on policy outcome. Using urban sustainability as our policy lens, we employ a mixed-methods approach to collect and analyze data from focus groups of local government officials, public and private archival repositories, and a nationwide survey to: (a) develop a refined conceptualization and empirical measure of cross-functional authority that captures its various dimensions and mechanisms of influence; (b) develop a comprehensive national dataset of multiple sustainability outcome measures that are comparable across cities; and (c) create the first longitudinal database on local sustainability policies spanning a ten year period, which is often considered the minimum amount of time necessary for nuanced examination of policy implementation and policy change. The collection of data will enable improved testing of local institutional and governance theories and its analysis will facilitate advances in urban management and sustainability outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, knowledge sharing remains a problem for many large organizations. Sometimes, problems of knowledge sharing occur because the knowledge itself is sticky; it requires deep contextual understanding to decode and apply. Other times, knowledge is difficult to transfer because individuals do not have the correct intensity of relationships (strong or weak) for the type of knowledge that needs to be transferred (tacit or explicit) such that individuals are unwilling to take the time and make the effort to teach a colleague something they do not know. In other cases, the problem is much simpler: People within the organization don't know what other people in the organization know and are therefore unable to seek or share with them.<br/><br/>The goal of this study is to understand how new enterprise social media can help to improve at least two important aspects of knowledge sharing: Helping people find the knowledge they need and helping them to build the correct kinds of relationships necessary to transfer certain kinds of knowledge. As organizations spend money and time on the implementation of these new technologies in an attempt to increase worker productivity, it seems timely and important to understand not only if such tools can overcome perennial problems associated with effective knowledge sharing, but also to elucidate the mechanisms by which such technologies affect knowledge sharing practices. In short, this research stands to unveil what happens when organizational communications that were once private become public and the consequences that this communication visibility can have for the organization as a whole. This research has high-impact potential for education, labor, and business policies as it considers strategies for retooling and reshaping the communication environments of organizations that are becoming increasingly distributed."

This project analyzes that organizational variety and its impact in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to determine how differences in lending organizations and the ecologies or mixes of lenders that populate banking markets shape ?and might enhance?access to credit for small business in poor and non-white communities. Ideally suited for this study, the PPP was a federal government program that worked though the nations? existing lenders to issue nearly 12 million loans to businesses to keep workers on payroll during the pandemic, and produced detailed data on where and to whom lenders lent.<br/><br/>To address the impact of lender organizational form and bank market ecologies on credit flows, this project combines interviews of lenders and borrowers with multi-level quantitative analyses of a new data set on all PPP loans that links: a) data on lending by seven lender types and socio-economic conditions in 32,000 communities, with b) data on the organizational compositions of 625 regional banking markets that served those communities. These analyses contribute broadly to understanding how organization shapes inequality, while extending organizational ecology and institutional research on organizational form and complexity to new outcomes.  They address a key gap in our knowledge of class and ethno-racial divides in banking and credit, integrating work in organizational studies, economic sociology and political economy on bank organization, banking systems and their economic impacts with research in sociology, law and allied fields, which extensively analyzes banking and credit as sites of discrimination and segregation, but commonly sets organizational variety in banking aside (or focus on large banks) to document broader systemic tendencies.  And by identifying possibilities for greater inclusivity within American banking?and in government programs that work though that system ? this project highlights new avenues for reform, including building the capacities of lenders that engage traditionally marginalized communities and altering mixes of institutions in regional markets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has enlisted the world in an involuntary and instantaneous ""beta-test"" of remote work at scale. In the span of a few weeks, shelter-in-place orders have come down from government agencies in the US and elsewhere requiring organizations to transition nearly their entire workforces to remote work arrangements instantaneously. Undoubtedly, these rapid and wholesale shifts to remote work arrangements are leveraging recent advances in the development of digital collaboration platforms that enable teams to communicate via text, audio, and video and to share and edit documents in real-time. However, until now, we have not had the need (or the will) to experimentally - and at scale - assess the ability of digital collaboration platforms to support an all remote workforce. The pandemic offers us an unprecedented opportunity to understand how the sudden switch to remote collaboration presents challenges and opportunities to distributed teams. Thus, this research seeks to answer fundamental questions about how workers organize for remote work before, during, and after a sudden shift to remote collaboration. This includes exploring the lasting impacts of COVID-19 on organizations, even after returning to the ""new normal."" <br/><br/>This project draws insights from studying workers. It leverages surveys (including questions about their social networks), HR data, as well as data from collaboration server logs that have been collected over the past year, prior to the pandemic, from four organizations. These data will be augmented by collecting new data from these same organizations to understand remote work during and post pandemic. These include surveys, HR data, collaboration server logs, as well as qualitative interviews. Taken together these longitudinal data will help us understand how the observed shifts in patterns of teamwork can be explained by the particular ways in which workers utilize technology before, during and after the COVID-19 crisis. It will explore how work-life blending and burnout differentially impact remote workers. Furthermore, to assess changes in how employees collaborate on and around digital platforms before, during, and after COVID-19 disruption, data will be collected that examine when and what workplace policies were put in place by organizations or other local, state or national agencies in response to COVID-19. These include decisions for partial evacuation of offices, total shelter-at-home, lay-offs for certain categories of employees, leave without pay for others, mandatory use of certain technologies, as well as phased re-entry back into the office. As such, the research project will advance our fundamental understanding of the manner in which digital collaboration technologies provide challenges and opportunities to teams collaborating - including the most extreme scenario - remotely. It will also provide an evidentiary base for how workplace related policy interventions impact the use of technology for teamwork. Results from this research will contribute to generating policy recommendations about how technologies should be used to enable collaboration at key transition points during a future crisis of this magnitude.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project addresses one of the grand challenges of this big data era - how can we harness these resources for societal good amidst many competing claims on the value to be derived from these data and the substantial risks for individual privacy and security? In the health care sector, yielding the greatest value possible from rapidly expanding digitalized health data resources is essential to address pressing societal issues related to cost, quality, safety and access. Health data governance remains challenged by technical, institutional and competitive factors. How health data are governed - by whom, for what purposes, on whose behalf and through what organizational forms and structures - are vital questions. This project examines how organizational forms develop around health data resources. Viewing health data as shared societal resources rather than merely as organizational assets calls into question whether new governance forms can develop, what influences their emergence, and what factors enable or limit effective governance of these resources. The findings from this study will develop new knowledge with application for policy settings as well for health system leaders and technology innovators on how to alter organizational forms to produce more value from health data and thereby improve the health care system and benefit public welfare. Findings will be disseminated to relevant health data organizations and associations such as the National Association of Health Data Organizations. This interdisciplinary project spanning communications, public health and information technology management contributes to research capabilities and educational curricula for health data management, data science, and information policy. <br/><br/>This project investigates three research questions: (1) What organizational forms emerge to address challenges and opportunities of big data governance? (2) What institutional and sociotechnical factors enable or inhibit the establishment of new organizational forms of data governance? (3) How do varied organizational forms address the multiple, possibly conflicting, interests and values of societal and organizational stakeholders to enhance value realized from data resources? These questions are addressed through a series of embedded case studies of an emerging organization form of health data governance, the All-Payer Claims Databases (APCD) in the U.S. health care sector. The three phases include a historical analysis of the APCD movement at the national level including the All-Payer Claims Database Council, in-depth case studies of four states' APCDs, and field-level analysis of the State of Hawai'i APCD project. Through comparative case analysis, the research examines how and why there is significant variation in organizational forms among 30 state projects and what are the implications for the societal, organizational, and individual value realized through these resources. The project supports theorizing the process and outcomes of governance form emergence, develops a series of embedded case study reports of APCDs, and creates an analytical codebook and structure useful for analyzing governance of other health data domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

RTOs are highly complex socio-technical organizations that are challenged to facilitate fundamental transformations in how electricity is produced and delivered, driven by individual state mandates requiring increased use of renewable fuel sources (primarily from variable sources such as wind and solar energy). RTOs must adapt to these mandates through policy innovation, a difficult organizational problem since decision-making by RTOs happens within a complex negotiation framework involving a large number of voluntary external stakeholders (e.g., electricity generating companies, regulators, consumer and environmental advocates). The focus of this comparative analysis among three RTOs (serving the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and California) is to understand how, why, and when these networks of conflicting stakeholders can lead to innovation. The approach blends direct observation of policy-formation processes with semi-structured interviews in an empirical investigation of the configuration of stakeholder networks within RTOs and the communication strategies employed by RTO stakeholders within the policy process.<br/><br/>RTOs play a critical role in the transition to more sustainable energy systems, making decisions that are pivotal to environmental quality, economic growth and security, and social well-being.

When a single issue or objective crosses multiple independent units, collective action and coordination problems can arise from fragmented authority. Local sustainability is a broad and complex issue and provides an ideal lens through which to study these organizational challenges. Despite the widespread adoption of sustainability goals by local governments, an administrative apparatus to coordinate their implementation is lacking or inconsistent in many communities. This research examines the impact that different administrative arrangements have on policy efforts and outcomes and assesses the institutional structures necessary to facilitate the success of local sustainability efforts. Functional coordination and collective action problems within a single government are similar to institutional collective action problems that arise from fragmented governmental authority within metropolitan areas. In both cases, the connectedness of services, objectives, and resource systems produces positive and negative externalities. Resolution of these dilemmas requires additional resources and expertise, as well as the development of administrative structures to integrate decision-making. This work intends to initiate a general theory of institutional collective action that encompasses administrative dilemmas within as well as between organizations. It proceeds in two stages: First, it will collect quantitative data on administrative institutions via surveys administered to local government officials. Second, eight cities will be selected for in-depth analysis based on characterizations developed from their survey responses. An analytic narratives approach and social network analysis will be applied to explore the mechanisms available for overcoming functional collective action dilemmas in local sustainability. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>Although functional coordination has long been a concern within public administration, these issues are not emphasized in contemporary policy theories. Little is known about how the design of administrative mechanisms influences organizational ability to integrate decisions and resolve functional collective action problems. Even less is known about how administrative mechanisms affect policy outputs and outcomes at the organizational level. Through an exploration of city sustainability policy, this research will initiate a theory of functional collective action that extends institutional collective action research beyond its current focus on horizontal and vertical fragmentation among independent governments. Findings will provide insight to address the common problem of ""fuzzy boundaries,"" whereby the lack of clear lines of responsibility for tackling complex policy issues necessitates more coordinated efforts. This research will systemically identify the strengths and weaknesses associated with different mechanisms for overcoming functional collective action and enable municipalities to make more informed choices and minimize administrative dilemmas within as well as between organizations. The results of this analysis are expected to be of applied value to local government practitioners. Additionally, the empirical survey data collected from this research will contribute to the broader study of urban governance and policy in the US and enable researchers to better examine sustainability and local government administration questions."

Three experiments test the core ideas of this leadership model, and develop tools for leadership assessment and program evaluation. These experiments manipulate configurations of leadership and observe the effects of doing so on the emergent structure of the collective, as well as the processes, states, and performance of these collectives. <br/><br/>The scientific study of leadership has long recognized that the behavior of leaders can have extraordinary effects on collectives including teams, units, and organizations. While much of the empirical research on leadership focuses on predicting outcomes that reside at the individual unit of analysis (e.g., job satisfaction, work performance), many of the situations where leaders are potentially most pivotal require complex collective interactions (e.g., coordination, information sharing). Disaster response, vaccine development, and provincial reconstruction are examples of goals that require action by large-scale collectives, and so require leaders to orchestrate the effort within those collectives. Not only do we need to understand how leaders shape collectives, but we need to understand how they shape loosely coupled virtual collectives or multiteam systems: large interdependent teams interacting through virtual tools, which are interdependent with one another in order to achieve at least one common goal.

The project evaluates an innovative and potentially transformative theory of leadership as a compilational multilevel process whereby ""leadership"" is comprised of the patterned interactions of multiple individuals collectively carrying out needed system functions. Three experiments test the core ideas of this leadership model, and develop tools for leadership assessment and program evaluation. These experiments manipulate configurations of leadership and observe the effects of doing so on the emergent structure of the collective, as well as the processes, states, and performance of these collectives. <br/><br/>The scientific study of leadership has long recognized that the behavior of leaders can have extraordinary effects on collectives including teams, units, and organizations. While much of the empirical research on leadership focuses on predicting outcomes that reside at the individual unit of analysis (e.g., job satisfaction, work performance), many of the situations where leaders are potentially most pivotal require complex collective interactions (e.g., coordination, information sharing). Disaster response, vaccine development, and provincial reconstruction are examples of goals that require action by large-scale collectives, and so require leaders to orchestrate the effort within those collectives. Not only do we need to understand how leaders shape collectives, but we need to understand how they shape loosely coupled virtual collectives or multiteam systems: large interdependent teams interacting through virtual tools, which are interdependent with one another in order to achieve at least one common goal.

On the one hand, sociological research convincingly argues for the ""dominance of teams in the production of knowledge,"" particularly in the production of ""high-impact"" knowledge. On the other hand, research shows that many science teams, particularly the ones most prized for their diverse and distributed ""dream teams"" are especially prone to underachieving when it comes to publications, patents, and commercialization. This program of research investigates a large number of scientific collectives, from their initial formation to their maturity, in order to uncover the dynamic interplay between structure (i.e., how the collective is designed) and process (i.e., leadership and member interactions). Although collaboration across disciplines and units has been frequently recognized as one of the key obstacles to innovation, research is needed to determine how system design affects the multi-level processes that facilitate collaboration within and across teams and units. This research integrates psychological, organizational, and network science perspectives in a multilevel system model to detail the impact of goals, leadership, and system design on key drivers of collaboration within and across teams in innovation systems. Four empirical studies are being conducted over the course of two years in order to evaluate the impact of variations in the architecture of scientific innovation systems on resulting innovation. This research investigates scientific collectives comprised of students working across two universities, three disciplines, and two countries who must work collaboratively to solve interdisciplinary challenges in environmental sustainability.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. The project develops an evidentiary-base for informing policy on how to manage scientific collaborations to foster innovation. In particular, this project will enable concrete prescriptions about the optimal integration of science and policy. The project identifies the structural and interactional building blocks of successful collaboration in scientific collective in which teams are distributed, are affected by complex social and motivational forces, and interact through virtual technology to innovate using knowledge across temporal and spatial boundaries. This project will yield greater understanding of how to improve, through design and leadership interventions, knowledge generation and policy implementation in multiteam science. A second set of broader impacts of the project concern the education of four communities: (1) future scientists, (2) science policy leaders, (3) academics, and (4) students. This project is enabling the training of future scientists who will work as part of distributed multidisciplinary international science teams. An estimated 10 PhD students and 10 research-oriented undergraduate students will have the opportunity to work directly on this research, engaging in virtual scientific collaboration. The project will create new curricula in distributed multidisciplinary teamwork at Georgia Tech aimed at computing and engineering students. At George Mason, this project will foster a continuing collaboration between instructors in the Environmental Science & Policy and Psychology programs.  This collaboration has as its goal the design of integrated curricula to help students understand how to use both principles of ecology and social psychology to foster greater environmental sustainability.  Finally, the project contributes to the teamwork training of more than 2,000 Engineering, Ecology, Psychology, and Business students who will participate in this research."

Partnerships between organizations may provide a variety of benefits. Through partnerships, organizations can share expertise and resources. Organizations can also take advantage of other gains made possible by working together. To encourage formation of partnerships among organizations, governments may implement policies that seek to increase awareness of the potential benefits of partnerships; that facilitate partnership formation; that remove barriers to partnership formation; and/or that incentivize partnerships. The extent to which such policies lead to partnership formation will depend on whether the policies address the primary factors inhibiting partnership formation. As organizations differ in the barriers they face and the benefits they might derive from partnerships, the effects of state policies may vary across organizations. To improve understandings of how policies influence partnership formation, this research evaluates a range of policy approaches for encouraging partnership formation as well as how multiple concurrent policies interact with one another. <br/><br/>Specifically, the research examines the response of small community water systems in the USA to policies seeking to steer development of water system partnerships. Most states in the USA have adopted one or more policies to encourage partnership formation by water systems. Those policies vary in whether their approach is enabling, authority-based, information-based, or incentive-based. The research analyzes the effects of these state policies, as well as how those effects and the critical barriers to partnership formation vary with the institutional structures of small community water systems (e.g., municipal, special district, community-owned, private) and with the forms of partnership that may be developed (e.g., informal, contracting, joint powers, consolidation). A mixed-methods approach is utilized: data collection entails both a survey of small community water systems across the USA and interviews with water system representatives and state-primacy agencies. Results from the research will provide insights regarding the points of intervention that serve to catalyze differing forms of partnerships and the impacts of linking multiple concurrent policies. Results will also illuminate how the effects of policies vary across a diversity of organizational structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The partnerships can take many forms including philanthropy, cause marketing, brand certification, and collective impact arrangements. Through communication, the contours of the partnership are made known to different stakeholder groups thereby influencing attitudes, intention to purchase, intention to donate, and intention to engage in activism. The research examines both activists and consumers' reactions to a variety of messages about corporate-NGO partnerships by using a series of three on-line experiments to map both consumers and activists' mental models of corporations and NGOs. This project fulfills three important objectives: (1) to further our understanding of the impact of communicated NGO-corporate partnerships on consumers and activists' attitudes, intention to purchase, intention to donate, and intention to engage in activism, (2) to understand the ways that such messages might overcome initially incongruent pairings through the inclusion of or exclusion of certain message characteristics, and (3) to understand how the different forms of NGO-corporate partnership may moderate these relationships. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this project is three-fold. First, it contributes to the study of semantic networks by investigating factors that shape how individuals' mental models evolve to incorporate new information. Second, this project extends previous marketing research on brand pairings to include a broader spectrum of social issues, stakeholders beyond consumers (i.e., activists), and multiple types of NGO-corporate partnerships. Third, it contributes to a broad-based understanding of the network of NGO-corporate partnerships through its testing of theoretically driven propositions. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This research offers three broader impacts for educational, policy and industry sectors. First, the project advances social science and computer science interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation by bringing together undergraduate and graduate student researchers. As such, it aims to train a new generation of students in scientific methods. Second, the findings will illuminate why some nonprofits are less likely to be supported by public funding thus allowing  policymakers to make informed decisions about which social issues could be turned over to private funding sources and which will continue to need taxpayer support. Third, as companies seek to improve relationships with consumers and limit risk exposure from activists, the findings will offer industry leaders information regarding how communication influences stakeholders support of partnerships."

Indeed, African American and Hispanic people comprise less than 10% of the STEM workforce. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to increase the recruitment, retention, and preparation of Hispanic and African American students for STEM careers. We focus on the subtle yet significant messages that minority students encounter in STEM contexts that undermine their success. We uniquely consider the ways that allies, or majority group members who strive to end oppression toward, and advocate on behalf of, minority group members, can effectively address subtle discrimination, and thus ultimately support the STEM interest, efficacy, achievement, and workplace success of minority students. In summary, the findings from this work will serve as an impetus for scholarship on minority stress interventions and ally engagement. Additionally, it will offer immediately applicable strategies for retaining African American and Hispanic students in STEM, a necessary step for increasing the representation of racial minorities in the U.S. STEM workforce.<br/><br/>This research pursues the overarching goal of developing and testing strategies that enhance the retention of African American and Hispanic students in STEM careers by identifying and evaluating ally behaviors that reduce the detrimental consequences of subtle discrimination. One explanation for this shortage is the subtle differences in students' formative college experiences. In so doing, we build and test a conceptual model that uniquely integrates attributional ambiguity and stress and coping theories with emerging insights about the influence of allies. We advance robust logic based on evidence from the fields related to the organizational science to propose that the ambiguity of subtle discrimination depletes cognitive and affective resources necessary for achievement in STEM. This reasoning reflects the first thorough analysis of why and how subtle discrimination is problematic and points directly to ambiguity reduction strategies as powerful theory-driven buffers of these effects. We blend complementary methods of experience sampling and laboratory experiment to build theoretically meaningful and practically useful knowledge. This work will provide specific, evidence-based strategies to support African American and Hispanic college students, thereby enhancing their STEM interest, efficacy, motivation, achievement, and ultimately career choice and success in organizations. In particular, we focus on the previously unexamined role of motivated observers--allies--in reducing the consequences of subtle discrimination for its targets and thus catalyze new diversity science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result of this work-family conflict, a parent may experience low morale at work, stress, and depression, all of which have profound effects on their work engagement and productivity. Such tension between work and family may potentially impact the home environment as well, including negative effects on how adolescent children in the family think, feel, and behave. However, we know little about these effects, and also whether a negative home environment may have similarly negative effects on parents at work. Our project seeks to study work-family conflict and its effects on the home environment (and vice versa) using controlled laboratory methods, and methods that allow for the study of these factors in ""real-life"" outside of the laboratory. By understanding the ways in which work-family conflict and the home environment influence each other, we may gain a better understanding of how to improve functioning in both work and home domain, and thus increase parents' work engagement and productivity.     <br/><br/>Many employees in the U.S. experience high demands to fulfill obligations both at work and at home (Galinsky et al. 2009). The incompatibility of heightened pressure from both work and home is referred to as work-family conflict (Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985), high levels of which place employees at increased risk for a host of poor work and psychosocial outcomes (e.g., job dissatisfaction, turnover, depression; Allen, 2012). Moreover, to the extent that child care poses demands in the family domain (Bianchi & Milkie, 2010), the children of employees are important stakeholders in the work-family interface. Yet, the role of employees? children in absorbing the impact or being a source of work-family conflict has received scant attention. Such issues are particularly important to address in families with adolescents. Specifically, work-family conflict creates contexts in which parents have fewer resources or time to monitor their adolescents' whereabouts and activities, likely placing adolescents at high risk for poor psychosocial outcomes (Smetana, 2008). In fact, relative to younger children, adolescents are more likely to display problem behaviors (e.g., depression and substance abuse) that increase parent-adolescent conflict, which may affect parents' time and energy at work. Thus, we propose to address research questions within families who have adolescent children. Specifically, we propose two studies that test both directions of a mediation model informed by the spillover hypothesis of life stressors (Staines, 1980). Based on prior work indicating that parent-adolescent conflict evidences reciprocal relations with children's psychosocial adjustment (Burt et al., 2005), we propose that the reciprocal relations between work-family conflict and adolescent psychosocial maladjustment are mediated by parent-adolescent conflict. Further, our team members have training in not only diverse social science disciplines, but also diverse research settings. Accordingly, we propose two studies that test the model described previously in both field and laboratory settings, allowing each study's strengths to address the limitations of the other study. First, we will test both directions of the above-mentioned mediation model using daily diaries, completed by both parents and adolescents, conducted over a two-week period to measure work-family conflict, parent-adolescent conflict, parental work functioning, and adolescent psychosocial functioning. Second, we will test the same theoretical model using a laboratory design. Specifically, we will recruit family dyads with one full-time working parent and one adolescent for a laboratory study. We will randomly assign each full-time working parent and adolescent dyad to one of three levels of the independent variable: (a) task induction of parental work stress and a low-stress condition for the adolescent, (b) task induction of adolescent psychosocial stress and a low-stress condition for the parent, and (c) both parent and adolescent assigned to a low-stress condition. Next, we will administer a controlled task meant to reflect parent-adolescent conflict (i.e., mediator variable), and we will objectively assess parent and adolescent physiological flexibility (i.e., an index of emotional dysregulation) during this task. We then will administer performance-based tasks of parental work functioning and adolescent psychosocial functioning to test the impact of parent-adolescent conflict on these domains, as well as the cross-domain, indirect impacts of parental work stress and adolescent psychosocial stress. The proposed project promises to improve our basic understanding of the spillover between parents? work experiences and non-work family life."

This project will evaluate the complex effects of work, including the absence of regular or meaningful work, on personality trait development in young adults. The results of this research will show what skills are needed to find a job and to succeed in the workplace, and provide valuable information about the effects of unemployment and underemployment on personality development. This information will help policy makers identify potential interventions that can aid underemployed workers in becoming more competitive for full-time permanent positions. Results from this project may be especially helpful to colleges and universities as they strive to promote successful transitions from college to the workforce. <br/><br/>The project will conduct a multi-wave longitudinal study of close to 1,000 graduating seniors from a large Midwestern university who are entering the workforce. Participants will be solicited from all available majors on campus and baseline data will be collected during their final semester in college. Subsequent surveys will be administered every six months for the first two years of the study to obtain detailed information about transitions to the workforce. Annual surveys will then be administered for two additional years to obtain longer-term information about personality trait change, workplace experiences, and the effects of unemployment or underemployment. Personality traits will be assessed at each time point using both self- and informant-reports. In addition, information will also be gathered about participant work experiences, perceived fit and engagement with their jobs, and investment in family and community activities.

Thus, there is a critical need to identify pathways through which employees can achieve work effectiveness and wellbeing, despite facing difficulties. Work resilience -- positive adaptation despite adversity at work -- is an advantageous tool that offers a path to success despite adverse experiences. We propose one unexplored way to increase resilience is through recovery, in which non-work time is used to recuperate from fatigue and negative mood built up during the work day. This project's goal is to understand how psychological (e.g., detachment from work, relaxation) and physical (e.g., sleep, exercise) recovery experiences relate to work resilience. Determining behaviors that improve resilience which are under individuals' control during their non-work time has the potential to benefit individuals, teams, and organizations across every occupation. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to uncover and model the dynamic interrelationship of psychological and physical work recovery experiences with work resilience. This project: 1) assesses potential psychological (fatigue) and physiological (heart rate variability) mechanisms that link work recovery and resilience; 2) examines the differential effects of alternative work recovery experiences (i.e., psychological and physical) on work resilience; and 3) delineates the temporal dynamics between work recovery and resilience, uncovering potential cumulative and reciprocal effects. We will conduct two experience sampling research studies using (a) a sample of traditionally employed participants who work during standard weekly business hours and (b) a sample of shift workers - employees who work alternative shifts that at least partially fall outside the daytime shift range (e.g., night shift and rotating shift employees) - to test the current model. Each study is a four-week daily survey study in a sample of 100 working adults that incorporates both objective behavioral and physiological indicators. By explicating the relative importance of different recovery experiences contributing to work resilience and the dynamic relationship between work recovery and resilience, this project could provide a theoretical foundation to enhance organizational effectiveness and employee wellbeing despite unavoidable adversities.

The first study will be a laboratory study, where teams will be ad-hoc, one-time meetings. These will be short-term teams that have no previous interaction. The laboratory conditions will allow for audio and video recording of the team interactions, which facilitates detailed and nuanced analysis of both cognitive and social processes. The laboratory study will also allow us to test an intervention using debriefs to facilitate reflection that fosters team reflexivity. Building on the findings from this initial study, our second study will recruit semester-long undergraduate teams in engineering design courses at University of Nebraska Lincoln (UNL) and Clemson. These teams work to develop a product or idea based on real client demands, for a semester long project.

This research will demonstrate a novel, graph-theoretic methodology that incorporates social and material dimensions into the portrayal of routines. This methodology can be used to assess and compare the influence of various antecedents on the complexity of clinical routines. This project will also result in new research infrastructure, in the form of algorithms and software that can be applied in future research on any kind of process or routine. This new research infrastructure is particularly timely and valuable because of the increasing availability of digital trace data, such as the electronic medical record data used here."

While existing research explores the wellbeing of employees in single teams, there's a gap in understanding how being part of multiple teams influences the experiences and overall wellbeing of individual team members and teams in organizations. This project addresses the relationship between multiple team membership (MTM) and wellbeing, crucial for organizational productivity. Individuals navigating multiple virtual teams experience ?context variety.? In other words, they move between diverse technological, task-related, and socio-psychological contexts. This includes using different platforms and emerging technologies (e.g., AI nudging tools), facing varying task requirements, and experiencing different levels of inclusion and psychological safety across teams. Despite being a common experience, prior research hasn't explored how team context variety influences individuals? and the entire team?s wellbeing, including both positive and negative outcomes, such as excitement or burnout. This research aims to integrate scholarly perspectives on teams, management information systems, and human resources, contributing to a richer theoretical understanding of MTM dynamics. The outcomes will contribute to improving workers' wellbeing and fostering inclusive work environments.<br/><br/>The specific goals of this project are to: a) understand how technology, task, and socio-psychological variety across teams affect individual and team wellbeing when team members are simultaneously members of multiple teams, and b) to help organizations, managers, and employees design supportive workplace experiences. The project focuses on multiple levels of analyses: the individual, the single team, and the meso-level, which is defined as a liminal space across multiple teams within an organization. The research team relies on a mixed method approach, including interviews to capture a holistic view of the lived experiences of multiple team membership of knowledge workers and develop a theoretical model, experiments to granularly analyze technology affordances, and surveys to confirm the proposed theoretical model we develop and to better capture variety in task and socio-psychological contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This has become a very important issue in modern society where developing successful solutions for complex problems requires collaboration among many individuals with diverse knowledge, expertise and behaviors, and where the interactions of those individuals are often complex and dynamic. The project will use multiple research methods to address this issue, combining computer simulations for idea and hypothesis generation and online experiments with human participants for idea and hypothesis testing. The project will expand knowledge about the linkage between individuals' interactions in various organizational configurations and their performance in innovation, which will be applicable to product, service, concept, policy, and/or aesthetic design tasks in a wide variety of domains.<br/><br/>As the complexity of products and services has skyrocketed over the last several decades, collective design and innovation processes have become a necessity for the development of successful solutions for real-world problems. Such large-scale design processes typically involve individuals with diverse knowledge, expertise and behaviors, and the organizational structures under which the collective design takes place are often complex and dynamic with temporally changing non-trivial network properties. This project aims to investigate, both theoretically and experimentally, how the diversity of knowledge, expertise, and behaviors of individual members and the topological properties of organizational network structures will affect the effectiveness of design and innovation processes at collective levels. This will be accomplished through (a) theoretical agent-based network modeling and simulation, and (b) model evaluation through online laboratory experiments involving student participants with diverse majors. Modeling and simulation will investigate potential interactions between task-related diversity and large-scale organizational network structures. The predictions produced by the simulations will be evaluated through online laboratory experiments, in which participants will collaborate on several open-ended collective design tasks through a computer-mediated collaboration platform. In these experiments, the participants? task-related diversity will be measured and its distribution in the organizational network will be manipulated. The topologies of the network will also be monitored and manipulated dynamically. The successful outcome of the project will be a new ""guiding principle"" for configuring and manipulating task-related diversity and organizational network structures to promote effective collective design and innovation. This will bear multidisciplinary impacts on organizational science, management science, systems science, systems engineering, operations research, and network science."

In this research, experts in Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA), Organizational Behavior and Information Science and Data Analytics disciplines will collaborate to provide answers to the following key questions: (a) what social and organizational factors affect technical system risk? (b) how and why do these factors influence risk? and (c) how much do they contribute to risk?  Existing PRA models do not include a complete range of organizational factors. This research investigates organizational root causes of failure and models their paths of influence on technical system performance, resulting in more comprehensive incorporation of underlying organizational failure mechanisms into PRA. The field of PRA has progressed the quantification of equipment failure and human error for modeling risk of complex systems; however, the current organizational risk contributors lack reliable data analytics that go beyond safety climate and safety culture surveys. This research fills that gap by developing predictive causal modeling and big-data theoretic technologies for PRA, expanding the classic approach of data management for risk analysis by utilizing techniques such as text mining, data mining and data analytics. In addition to scientific contributions to organizational science, PRA, and data analytics, this research provides regulatory and industry decision-makers with important organizational factors that contribute to risk and leads to optimized decision making. Other applications include real-time monitoring of organizational safety indicators, efficient safety auditing, in-depth root cause analysis, and risk-informed emergency preparedness, planning and response. The multidisciplinary approach of this project can serve as an educational model, empowering students to pursue research across disciplinary boundaries.  Finally, the proposed research represents a successful model of industry-academia collaboration. A nuclear power plant has committed to this project and provides unique access to data and information necessary to complete the research. The proposed methodology is generic and applicable for any high-risk industry (e.g., aviation, healthcare, oil and gas), and will be used for the improvement of organizational safety performance in order to protect workers, the public and the environment. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>Organizations produce, process and store a large volume of wide-ranging, unstructured data as a result of business activities and compliance requirements (i.e., corrective action programs, root cause analysis reports, oversight and inspection data, etc.). This research leverages those data resources for the quantification of organizational failure mechanisms and their integration with the technical system risk scenarios generated by PRA. The research is based on a socio-technical risk theory to prevent misleading results from solely data-informed approaches. Combining socio-technical risk theory, systematic modeling and semantic data analytics strategies will greatly enhance risk analysis of complex systems. We will conduct our research based on following steps: (1) Expand factors, sub-factors, and causal relationships in the Socio-Technical Risk Analysis (SoTeRiA) framework, (2) Develop measurement techniques for factors, sub-factors and their causal relationships in SoTeRiA (e.g., integrating text mining with the Bayesian Belief Network; conducting scientific reduction to identify important factors; measuring of important factors), (3) Establish a dynamic, predictive socio-technical causal modeling technique, (4) Perform uncertainty analysis, (5) Conduct verification and validation, (6) Integrate the quantitative socio-technical causal model with PRA, and (7) Conduct sensitivity and importance measure analyses. As the pioneer study on the integration of big data with PRA, this research addresses and quantifies risk emerging from the interface of social and technical systems."

We address these challenges by proposing to create a leadership training platform to be used by LDP workers to train the next generation of diverse leaders to adapt to an online setting. The proposed platform leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) models to provide real-time feedback to leaders. An interactive dashboard including visualization and storytelling will be developed as the front-end to provide information on leaders? performance to improve their leadership signals. The proposed work will have practical implications for numerous stakeholders. First, LDP will be able to effectively train current and emerging leaders to work in the virtual setting. Second, future leaders and their followers will benefit from the improved training. Third, the approach aims to substantially reduce discrimination in leadership evaluations by creating objective and diverse training data.<br/><br/>The current scope of work within the award is focused on creating partnerships and further developing the proposed work. The award will support on-site and virtual meetings and observations of end users of the proposed AI platform (i.e., LDPs).

Identity communication is defined as the methods that a person uses to convey his/her identity (Thatcher, Doucet, & Tuncel, 2001) and identity verification refers to the process of bringing others to confirm one's identity (Swann, 1983). The technology that facilitates communication in virtual teams can distort individual-level identities by heightening (Walther, 2008) or hiding (Weisband, 2002) them. The technology can thus create a social barrier to participation in virtual teams, negatively influencing a number of individual and group outcomes, including overall team success (Gomez, Huici, Seyle, & Swann, 2009). We adopt a mixed-methods research approach (Venkatesh, Brown, & Bala, 2013) to develop design guidelines for systems that improve identity communication and verification in virtual environments. Data will be collected in three phases, leveraging qualitative and quantitative techniques including interviews, surveys, and experiments.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project are in four key areas. First, our research will result in specific guidelines for designing information technology to support effective identity communication and verification in virtual environments. We will explain how the characteristics of various communication media influence identity communication and verification. Organizations can use this information not only during the onset of new virtual teams, but also as continuous improvement initiatives or when new members join an existing team. Second, we help organizations understand how to choose among different types and characteristics of communication technology to most effectively manage identity communication and verification. By understanding users' individual and task-related needs, organizations can deploy the best technologies to improve identity communication and verification given these specific characteristics. Third, with the increased use of online learning environments, we expect that the results of this work can be used to enhance both the teaching and learning experience by providing guidelines to enhance identity communication and verification in the educational context. For example, a common criticism of online learning experiences is that students do not feel a connection with their instructors or other students. Understanding how technology can enhance identity communication and verification can go a long way in helping us to develop effective online teaching tools. Fourth, a better understanding of identity communication and verification in virtual teams will have direct implications for NSF-sponsored virtual organizations, enhancing the effectiveness of cross-disciplinary and remote collaborations. Virtual teams offer a cost-effective and practical way to bring together diverse people from cross-disciplinary fields regardless of temporal or spatial restrictions; however, even face-to-face cross-disciplinary teams often experience communication difficulties (Oetzel, 2008), and these difficulties are generally exacerbated in virtual settings. By pointing the way toward more effective and sustainable virtual organizations, our research can thus strengthen the cyber-infrastructure for cross-disciplinary science and engineering research."

When done effectively, this ability can help organizations reduce repeated mistakes, spread innovation and best practices, and avoid dedicating resources to problems that have been solved previously.  To date, various organizational mechanisms to govern knowledge have been proposed and implemented, yet they have had limited and varying effects on knowledge mobilization.  Thus, there is a pressing need to better understand how to govern knowledge and effect knowledge mobilization across the entire organization.<br/><br/>Knowledge governance is concerned with how the deployment of organizational mechanisms influences knowledge processes, i.e., the creation, retention, and sharing of knowledge.  Traditionally, knowledge is governed in organizations through social and control mechanisms through the implementation of Communities of Practice (CoPs) and hierarchical reporting structures.  In addition to these traditional mechanisms, this research will analyze the creation of a new form of knowledge governance - a knowledge market, where knowledge is created, priced and sold internally - within a multinational engineering organization.  Thus, this research builds from institutional theory, transaction cost economics and the knowledge-based view of the firm to (i) analyze the design and evolvement of an internal knowledge market; (ii) compare and contrast the governance of knowledge through internal knowledge markets and traditional Communities of Practice; and (iii) analyze how different forms of governance affect knowledge mobilization. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit <br/>This research is expected to expand upon theories of intra-organizational knowledge governance.  Specifically, by analyzing a new form of knowledge governance (i.e., internal knowledge markets), this research introduces market mechanisms into intra-organizational analysis.  In addition, this research will create a theoretical framework for analyzing and comparing different forms of knowledge governance (e.g., centralized approaches vs. CoPs vs. internal knowledge markets) and determining the effects of these governance strategies on knowledge creation, renewal, reach within an organization.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>This research will engage industry throughout the data collection and analysis process to validate and refine our findings.  A toolkit and best practice guide on how to create an effective internal knowledge market and how different governance forms affect knowledge mobilization will be created and disseminated to organizations.  In addition, a course module will be created from this research for teaching in Universities.  Overall, the research aims to aid knowledge intensive organizations, such as engineering organizations with globally distributed knowledge workers, in their mobilization of knowledge to increase productivity and improve performance through the implementation of more efficient knowledge governance mechanisms."

The methods include a difference-in-differences analysis, testing whether entrepreneurial activity grew more in border regions than in areas farther from the border from before to after the FTA. They also involve a spatial econometric analysis methodology, which is new to the entrepreneurship literature, developed specifically for this context that will allow researchers to integrate detailed spatial micro-data in the U.S. with coarser aggregated data from Canada. <br/><br/>In terms of broader impacts, this research should shed light on which factors of local economic activity (such as the availability of local financing, skilled workforce, potential customers, and suppliers) have the most important effects on economic growth and development.

The question, then, is how to leverage team diversity toward team goals. Common wisdom behind the ""business case for diversity"" purports that diversity is a resource that enhances team success. Social science findings, however, suggest that diversity can instead yield stifled and conflictual team process that undermines team outcomes. These detrimental effects are pronounced when diverse attributes align in meaningful ways; like cracks in the surface of the earth, subgroup divisions - faultlines - can emerge that restrain performance. The emergent problem is how to prevent and overcome the fractured behavioral dynamics of faultlines to allow team diversity to be effectively leveraged toward effective performance.<br/><br/>The goal of this set of studies is to explore the conditions under which diversity facilitates rather than hinders team performance. It is anticipated that the promise of diversity can be achieved (and pitfalls avoided) in conditions under which dysfunctional, fractured behavioral patterns are prevented. Drawing from theories that explain the challenges and opportunities of team diversity, the current studies explore three conditions that may enable the benefits of diversity: high levels of team identification, pro-diversity values, and social connectedness. Overall, this work will shape scholarly discourse and organizational practice regarding when and how members' diverse characteristics can facilitate team performance.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This work will meaningfully contribute to organizational science by identifying factors that inhibit and facilitate quality performance in diverse teams. It will shift the simplistic lens of diversity as a unidimensional feature of teams toward an approach that emphasizes the complex behavioral patterns that can emerge when team members' characteristics coincide. To do this, the current studies will examine diversity from a more multidimensional viewpoint: team faultlines. In addition, the studies will use the newly available technology of sociometric sensors to examine how diversity faultlines manifest themselves in subtle ways in the social interactions of team members. This will allow the current researchers to: (1) address equivocal findings about the effects of team diversity, (2) challenge the dominant assumption that faultlines necessarily exist when demographic categories align, (3) explore the complex behavioral manifestations generated by faultlines, and finally (4) examine conditions under which the effects of faultlines can be attenuated. These advancements will shape scholarly understanding about the ways in which team diversity can positively and negatively impact performance. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This research will have broad-reaching impact on both science and society. Indeed, the theoretical bases and empirical findings of this research will provide a unique explanation for previous equivocal conclusions about team diversity. Moreover, this research will transform the way scholars approach team diversity by focusing on the particular patterns of behavior that constrain performance. Indeed, the unique methodological approach, which brings the power of ""bigger data"" from sociometric sensors to the study of team dynamics, will spur new insights and research paradigms. The broader impacts further extend to individuals, organizations, and society. Individuals may gain new insights into interpersonal dynamics and the subtle behavioral patterns that reinforce intergroup biases. This work will also identify (and empirically assess in experimental and field contexts) moderating conditions that organizations can shape to maximize the potential of workforce diversity. Ultimately, the simultaneous proliferation of team-based organizational systems and demographic diversity yields the potential for exceptional team outcomes. The findings of this work are thus timely and instructive for enhancing team effectiveness and resolving faultlines in the many contexts where diverse teams work toward shared goals."

Digital technologies have substantially changed the landscape of the industry, with online delivery becoming an essential revenue source for restaurants. Delivery platforms collect customer orders via a mobile app and have drivers pick up the food and deliver it to customers. These platforms, however, have had an uneasy partnership with restaurants. Delivery platforms possess strong power over independent restaurants and set platform fees as high as 30% to extract most of the surplus created on their platforms. Although there are heated debates on whether and how to regulate delivery platforms, the lack of empirical studies hinders the progress towards effective policymaking. This project investigates the impact of delivery platforms on restaurants and the implications for policymakers. The findings from this project advance our knowledge on how on-demand platforms and other powerful platforms create value for businesses, organizations, and our society. This project also enhances our knowledge about how to regulate powerful platforms.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project has three objectives: 1) Investigating the Realities of On-Demand Delivery. Whether restaurants benefit from delivery platforms, or what types of restaurants are more likely to benefit (e.g., independent vs. chain) are fundamental questions of importance to restaurant owners and policymakers; 2) Investigating the Effectiveness of Current Regulatory Policies. More than a dozen of cities and states have recently imposed regulations that cap the commissions that delivery platforms can charge. This project investigates if such regulatory policies are effective, and the promises and perils of implementing such regulations; 3) Designing Optimal Regulatory Policies. Building on the findings from 1) and 2), this project seeks to design optimal regulatory policies that improve total social welfare, balancing restaurant revenue, consumer surplus, and the sustainability of the on-demand delivery business.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the world has become more dynamic and interconnected, temporary organizations have been increasingly employed across diverse industries like construction, film-making, shipbuilding, software development, advertising, biotechnology, and fashion. Yet despite their increased prevalence, temporary organizations are struggling to foster and maintain coherent social norms. As opposed to traditional, long-term organizations, most members of temporary organizations possess different organizational backgrounds and a relatively short tenure. This project will investigate how employees' behaviors can be better aligned with desirable social norms through the reconciliation of multiple foci of organizational identifications in temporary organizations. The researchers will use construction workers' safety behavior as a case study of employee behavior in a temporary organization. The construction industry provides a particularly useful site for inquiry due to its central role in our economy, its wide use of temporary organizations, its status as among the most dangerous industries in the world, and the pervasiveness of accidents caused by workers' unsafe behaviors.<br/><br/>The project will extend theories on temporary organizations and organizational identification by characterizing the mechanisms through which desirable social norms are translated into organizational members' behaviors with the help of organizational identification. The project will incorporate diverse empirical data collection methods (e.g., survey, behavioral economic experiment, and behavior sampling) and analyses to investigate the role of multiple organizational backgrounds and social norms in shaping employee behavior in a temporary organization. In addition, working with the industry partners, the researchers will conduct quasi-field experiments to develop and test a series of one-time, short-term managerial training that can promote employees' social identification with the umbrella organization and ultimately to elicit desired changes in improving employees' behavior. The results will greatly contribute to the advancement of social identity theory and organization studies. Further, by identifying effective managerial actions/strategies to increase workers' project identification, the project will contribute to the development of organizational actions/strategies that can overcome heterogeneous organizational backgrounds and short tenure issues in a temporary organization, which will eventually improve employee behaviors like safety. Finally, this project will provide career development opportunities for diverse groups of students. The effective education of students and professionals for social influence-based management approaches will increase the competitiveness of U.S industries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Access to these services is crucial to ensure the health and welfare of individuals and their families. However, nonprofit services are not universally or broadly available to everyone because where one lives matters, and access to nonprofit organizations is more limited in suburban and rural communities. Focusing on immigrants in particular, the United States is home to over 43 million immigrants; over half lack U.S. citizenship. Relative to other disadvantaged groups, immigrants often face additional obstacles to accessing social and human services due to language barriers or service restrictions based on citizenship. This project studies the extent of inequalities in nonprofit immigrant services in health care, legal assistance, and refugee resettlement. The project investigates the reasons behind nonprofit service inequalities across place, type of immigrant community, and type of service, comparing the influence of demand, supply, and political factors. Beyond advancing knowledge about the contours of the nonprofit sector, the project will produce a publicly accessible database and web-based map of non-profit organizations and demographic data in 80 counties in the U.S. Southwest. These data will help philanthropists, political leaders, and public officials efficiently and equitably direct funding and programs to fill service gaps, connecting those who need services to nonprofit organizations. <br/> <br/>Immigrants are often in need of social and human services, but may lack ready access to non-profit organizations that provide such assistance.  This project will study services at the organizational level, mapping service provision in: (1) health care by using the federally funded health clinics dataset on the Health Resources and Services Administration Data Warehouse from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; (2) immigration legal assistance using the Immigration Advocates Network National Immigration Legal Services Directory, the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc. (CLINIC), and the United States Department of Justice Executive Office for Immigration Review, and (3) refugee resettlement services drawing from the Office of Refugee Resettlement?s State Programs Directory. The project will cover 80 counties in the U.S. Southwest, including all of Arizona and Nevada and 49 counties in north and central California and will identify specific types of services, language provision, fee structures, etc. Underlying demographic data to test demand theories of nonprofit service provision will come from the American Community Survey (ACS 2014-18) to capture recent immigration, citizenship, foreign-born population, foreign-born without health insurance, individuals with limited English proficiency per language group, and immigrants living under the poverty line. To test supply theories, the project will draw on ACS data, information on county budgets, and proximity to law schools. Political variables will include data on partisanship, voting patterns, the party affiliation of elected officials, and past histories of immigrant rights mobilization. The analysis will build upon the two-step floating catchment area method to develop a service mismatch index that balances supply and demand. Findings from the project will inform sociological theories of organizations, immigration, race and the role of politics in service provision.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the need for social distancing, the ability to continue essential business functions through effective remote work arrangements is a key means for addressing the global health crisis. However, many organizations are unprepared to accommodate a remote workforce and likewise lack insight into best practices as to how to promote continued productivity and well-being of the workforce in such arrangements. Although there is a large body of extant research on remote work arrangements, numerous questions remained under investigated. This project will address these gaps by studying the impact of several organizational, individual, technological, and supervisor characteristics on remote worker adjustment, well-being, and productivity. Findings from the project will provide evidence-based best practices that many large and small businesses can use both during future pandemics and other extreme events, but also going forward in normal work environments that may increasingly want to support remote work.<br/><br/>The COVID-19 pandemic has suddenly promoted the need for remote work arrangements on a vast scale, but we lack key information regarding what makes such work productive and sustainable. This project will obtain data from 500 full-time employees who are working remotely during the response to COVID-19 but were not doing so previously. The first phase of the project will collect a baseline survey that captures characteristics and experiences prior to the pandemic and remote work transition and general perceptions of the adjustment to remote work process. Phase 2 involves a 30-day experience sampling study administered daily at the end of each workday that will capture day-to-day experiences, attitudes, and performance of remote workers. Benefits of this panel design are: 1) provides insights into how multiple dynamic changes influence outcomes; 2) enhances ecological validity; 3) allows researchers to examine both within- and between-person processes; and 4) reduces retrospective recall biases. The project will partner with several work organizations to collect the data. Data from Phase 1 will be analyzed using regression and dominance analysis; data from Phase 2 will be analyzed using multi-level modeling which controls for nested structures, adjusting standard errors to take into account the lack of independence. These analyses also control for between-subject variables and previous measurements while also accounting for missing data. Findings from the project will inform organizational theories involving the effects of organizations, individuals, work, and technology on workers and work outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research consistently supports their efficacy in hiring, and yet biodata implementation is hindered by the proprietary nature and restricted availability of biodata questions, alongside insufficient data on individual item and scale properties across work settings. To overcome these challenges, this project leverages natural language processing (NLP) to build the most comprehensive, publicly accessible biodata repository. Paired with a linked work analysis, the repository houses thousands of items across dozens of constructs, including their psychometric properties. This project, therefore, helps democratize biodata and empower users to create tailored biodata scales within organizations, as well as provide rigorous tests of the efficacy of different types of biodata inventories. Moreover, this project will explore biodata?s potential for reducing adverse impact and test bias, addressing a concern in personnel selection.<br/><br/>This project begins by crafting prototypical items to assess dozens of work-related constructs. This initial item pool is being expanded by using automated item generation via NLP, paired with researcher refinement and content validity judgments. Data are being gathered for the biodata content, along with work-related dependent variables. Empirical, rational, and hybrid scoring keys are being developed, and a job analysis tool as well to help users identify optimal biodata content and to estimate validity based on the job analysis. Finally, all content are examined for potential group differences to determine susceptibility to adverse impact or statistical test bias. In sum, this research establishes a comprehensive biodata repository paired with an empirical database of reliability, validity, and adverse impact information for biodata scales and items, thus leading to improved hiring methods and expanding biodata knowledge and expertise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studies attempting to understand and solve the issues of absence behavior in the workplace traditionally have focused on individual causes of absence. However, these attempts to identify and remove individual causes have received only modest empirical support. Instead, the view that absence emerges from an individual's social or cultural environment (the absence culture) has become increasingly popular. We aim to study how such relationships can be seen in situations like construction where workers move from jobsite to jobsite. In addition, we will study how absence culture rooted in primary workgroups affect individual decisions related to absence in these situations. The specific objectives of this research are: 1) to identify the feedback processes between individual absence behavior and absence culture, focusing on how the social context affects individual behavior and how a culture forms on construction jobsites; 2) to apply computer simulation techniques to study complex and multi-determined job behaviors like absenteeism; and 3) to incorporate the impact absenteeism-related policies have on both absenteeism levels and construction performance into the boundary of the modeling scope, so that diverse policies can be simulated and tested prior to execution.<br/> <br/>In terms of broader impacts, the study will provide practical insights into absence-control policies thatcan foster positive work cultures and promote employee attendance. Employee absenteeism is a costly problem in the U.S. construction industry, so it is hoped the results can matter to competitiveness. Positive work cultures can also lead to the achievement of a significant increase in the productivity, quality, and safety of construction work. The findings of this research can also be applied to the study of other work outcomes, such as performance, citizenship, lateness, and turnover."

Such routines are believed to be responsible for the efficiency advantages of organizations as structures for collective decision-making. Nevertheless, to date there has been little formal modeling or evidence collected as to how organizational routines emerge, endure and adapt to change. This project proposes an agenda for studying the emergence, maintenance, adaptability and optimality of organizational routines that combines game theoretic analysis with experimental evidence. The baseline model is a novel but simple ""harvesting game"" wherein teams of agents repeatedly harvest a grid over several periods with full information about all past choices. The team's goal is to uncover as many novel outcomes on the grid as possible in the time allowed but without the ability to communicate with one another. The absence of communication proxies for specialization by team members that makes communication difficult or for settings where communication is impractical, for example during an emergency response. In such environments there are easily identifiable optimal routines and this study examines both theoretically and experimentally which routines emerge, how long it takes them to emerge, whether they are stable once they emerge, and if agents make short-run sacrifices in the interest of promoting the emergence of optimal routines. <br/><br/>This research will build upon and extend the baseline model by studying routine formation in variants where 1) there is no information about past choices, 2) the complexity of the decision task is increased, 3) more players are added, 4) some players have private, payoff-relevant information that may naturally position them as team leaders and 5) players have the ability to communicate with one another prior to making their harvesting decisions. The new framework will broaden understanding of how members of organizations learn to form routines in a variety of different environments that are all amenable to theoretical and experimental evaluation. Thus will bring game-theoretic analysis and rigor to the organizational routine literature which to date has been studied using the methods of psychology and organizational behavior researchers. The game-theoretic framework allows one to assess the extent and source of deviations in routine formation from the rational choice ideal so that there is a better understanding of the role played by bounded rationality in routine formation. In addition, data on organizational routines are difficult to measure or observe -- the experimental tests proposed using the methods of experimental economics, where subjects earn payments based on their own choices and the choices of other members of their same team, provides an excellent framework in which to study organizational routines. The experimental designs, programs, data and findings resulting from this proposal will be made freely available so that other researchers can build upon the new framework and instructors can teach this new approach to organizational routines in the classroom."

Three questions are analyzed 1) Why do some high technology industries have higher rates of scientist mobility and entrepreneurship than others? 2) What are the innovation diffusion patterns across high technology industries due to mobility and entrepreneurial entry of scientific personnel? 3) How do industry characteristics interact with firm and individual attributes to impact employment growth of new ventures created by industrial scientists? <br/><br/>The project centers on the role of complementary assets and posits that inter-industry differences in their importance play a critical role in explaining industry heterogeneity in the rates and outcomes of industrial scientist mobility and entrepreneurship decisions and thus serve as the theoretical underpinnings for all three research questions. A particular focus is on inter-industry differences in the importance and transportability of complementary non-human assets, how they shape the career decisions of individual scientists, and how they affect both the levels of scientist mobility and entrepreneurship within industries and the direction of scientist mobility and entrepreneurship that occurs across industry boundaries. The empirical analysis of the data focuses on scientists working in high-tech industry settings tracks scientists? entrepreneurship and mobility within and between these high-tech sectors.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: In contrast to most of the prior literature that studied the antecedents and consequences of the career choices of scientists at the firm level and within a single industry context, this research examines the questions by focusing on individual level decisions in a broad cross-industry setting. This thus examines multiple important gaps that are of interest to both policy makers and academics. In particular, by building the micro-foundations of the knowledge diffusion process at the individual scientist unit of analysis, it helps to build a systematic understanding of inter-industry differences in industrial scientist mobility and entrepreneurship in high tech industries. Understanding industry heterogeneity in the antecedents and consequences of the career choices of industrial scientists is particularly important in the context of understanding and promoting industry renewal as scientists are likely to play a key role in the creation and commercialization of new technologies which can have important growth effects at the firm-, industry-, and regional-level.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The study informs science and innovation policy makers about what industry conditions are most conducive to employment growth via entrepreneurship by scientific personnel. In addition, it examines the results of incentivizing a potentially crucial but heretofore under-examined source of high tech entrepreneurship: scientists employed outside of the focal industry. The results may also inform scientists' career decisions about industry-level factors that may facilitate or create impediments to successful start-up entry and subsequent growth."

Environmental conservation frequently comes at a cost to individuals, and sustaining resources often requires cooperation between users.  But cooperative, durable organizations that manage resources sustainably do sometimes arise. Therefore, an examination of the processes that influence the emergence and persistence of cooperative organizations that maintain conservation practices should be of value for advancing sustainability science and organizational theory alike. Linking theory on the evolution of organizations, institutions, cooperation and culture, this career development plan assembles a conceptual framework for the emergence and persistence of organizations that support costly conservation practices. The plan then applies this framework to a case study of cooperative local food organizations in Maine, employing formal and informal education to transform the capacity of citizens, students and stakeholders to conceptualize and engage in organizational change necessary to shape sustainable solutions.<br/><br/>The planned research uses an evolutionary framework to explore the patterns of institutional emergence associated with costly conservation. The integration of three research elements will supply convergent validity to a contextual study of the evolution of sustainable institutions: (1) Theoretical models will develop insights about which combinations and sequences of institutional features tend to emerge in stable, conservative groups. Model development will be interleaved with (2) a case study of cooperative, self-organized local food organizations using interviews, surveys, economic games and a randomized controlled trail to characterize institutional variation and change. (3) Local food organizations will be treated as stakeholders in a collaborative facilitation process designed to empower groups to set and meet self-identified goals.<br/><br/>The planned educational effort engages students, stakeholders, and citizens in learning, measuring and improving the ability of organizations to achieve cooperative goals. Five cohorts of ~30 students each will be directly engaged in the research through a student-driven statewide survey. New cross-listed courses will bridge economics, psychology and anthropology by focusing on endogenous organizational dynamics and methods for measuring them quantitatively. Constituents in local food organizations will be provided educational materials designed to improve their institutional efficacy. Finally, theory, methods and findings will be shared through web-based educational simulations with high school to graduate students, and an ongoing collaboration with a local children's museum.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>This plan supplies an evolutionary theory of the emergence and persistence of conservation behaviors and seeks to identify the institutional features that stabilize them. Methodologically, the research bridges social-science boundaries, by synthesizing evidence from experiments, models, surveys, interviews and a randomized controlled trial. This multi-disciplinary approach aims to provide a dynamic model that contributes to evolutionary organizational science and promises to make nascent sustainability theory more predictive and generalizable.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The plan includes two major investments in stakeholder driven-research. First, a collaborative stakeholder facilitation process will empower local food groups to self-identify goals and benchmarks to improve group efficacy. The facilitation will be rigorously evaluated via randomized controlled trial, and supply information on how recent research may help groups achieve their goals. Second, an iterative, multi-year collaboration with state-level food industry and food policy organizations such as the Maine Food Strategy will enable these stakeholders to co-direct the research efforts, shaping the research questions addressed in a summative local foods analysis conducted in year five. This collaboration increases the likelihood that the research described here will be of direct value for the development of food policy in Maine, New England and beyond."

Given the large number of cases (nearly 90,000 local governments) and considerable institutional and contextual variation across and within local governments, one might assume that the study of US local elections is an area of substantial scholarly investigation. And yet this is a relatively unexplored area of inquiry. The absence of scholarly research on local elections is significant, since 96% of the nearly half million elected officials in the US represent local rather than state or federal jurisdictions, and since municipalities have the largest share of elected officials, with 27% (US Census Bureau 1995). <br/><br/>The Local Elections in America Project (LEAP) will accomplish two goals. First, it offers a path-breaking methodology to create a centralized, comprehensive, and cost effective local elections database that will provide unparalleled opportunities for learning about local elections and the political, racial and socio-demographic features of American cities. The software application will systematically collect, digitize, and disseminate data on city council and mayoral elections, employing an automated system that will continue to collect elections data long into the future without ongoing external funding. Moreover, the application will be highly flexible and could therefore be adapted to handle different types of elections (e.g., school board or judicial contests) or units of analysis (precincts). <br/><br/>The second goal of this project is to use the LEAP database as the foundation for research that focuses on the centrality of race/ethnicity in local electoral politics. The increasing racial/ethnic heterogeneity of the US population is nowhere more evident than at the local level, which means that local elections provide the best arena for testing a whole range of theories. This component of the project focuses on the emergence and political ambition of minority candidates in American politics and the role of candidate and voter race/ethnicity in the process and outcome of American elections. To date almost no studies have examined the conditions under which minority candidates run for office and there is little in the way of theory to guide understanding of the ""supply side"" of minority representation. Is the lack of minority representation in elective office due to the defeat of the minority candidate or the absence of minority candidates? No study has even ventured a guess at this question. Other specific questions this project will address include: Under what conditions do African Americans and Latinos decide to run for local office, and how is their ""path to office"" different than that of their white counterparts? And, once the minority candidates are victorious, what is the trajectory of their political careers? How does candidate race/ethnicity shape the competitiveness of municipal elections (including primaries)? <br/><br/>LEAP represents an unprecedented advancement in the areas of data collection and dissemination. The project creates the much needed infrastructure to describe systematically, as never before, the landscape of local politics and elections, to test empirically an unprecedented range of social science theories that have heretofore been little studied in the context of local politics, and to establish an automated and ongoing process of data collection. The database will provide a crucial corollary to current databases and open up local elections to scholars outside of urban politics. Making the LEAP data available via an interactive website will maximize access and use for social scientists, educators, and stakeholder groups.<br/><br/>This award was partially funded by the Office of Cyberinfrastructure (OCI) CF21 Venture Fund for promoting the reuse of Cyberinfrastructure (CI) elements."

However, we lack systematic evidence on the types of strategies entrepreneurs should use when forming their teams. This project will investigate how initial team formation affects entrepreneurial outcomes. To what extent does team formation determine the level of specialization, coordination, and trust between team members? Do these processes affect team ability to change direction over time? Is it better to form teams with family members, or with friends or co-workers?  Does the best strategy change with context, such as different countries or industries? Findings from this project will provide practical advice to early stage entrepreneurs helping to increase the survival of young firms, thus promoting economic development in our society.  <br/><br/>The project pairs an archival study with a randomized control trial to evaluate how variations in team composition affect entrepreneurial outcomes. The first study follows technology-based startup teams in multiple iterations of a prestigious entrepreneurship contest. Over a period of eight months, teams seek to pass three competition rounds that weed the number of teams from 130 accepted teams to 30 semi-finalists to 12 finalists. The finalists present their ventures to venture capitalists. Data on team formation and interpersonal dynamics, along with demographic attributes, are collected through multi-source surveys over time. The second study, a randomized controlled trial, manipulates team formation processes to identify causal relationships between entrepreneurial team formation and outcomes. In a quasi-experimental setting comprised of multiple sections of an introductory semester-long entrepreneurship course, students pitch ideas, form teams and then start and run actual businesses. Team success will be evaluated in terms of actual profits and other measured milestones. This project will inform the field regarding whether it is worthwhile to intervene and facilitate team formation processes, or allow teams to form more organically.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result of this work-family conflict, a parent may experience low morale at work, stress, and depression, all of which have profound effects on their work engagement and productivity. Such tension between work and family may potentially impact the home environment as well, including negative effects on how adolescent children in the family think, feel, and behave. However, we know little about these effects, and also whether a negative home environment may have similarly negative effects on parents at work. Our project seeks to study work-family conflict and its effects on the home environment (and vice versa) using controlled laboratory methods, and methods that allow for the study of these factors in ""real-life"" outside of the laboratory. By understanding the ways in which work-family conflict and the home environment influence each other, we may gain a better understanding of how to improve functioning in both work and home domain, and thus increase parents' work engagement and productivity.     <br/><br/>Many employees in the U.S. experience high demands to fulfill obligations both at work and at home (Galinsky et al. 2009). The incompatibility of heightened pressure from both work and home is referred to as work-family conflict (Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985), high levels of which place employees at increased risk for a host of poor work and psychosocial outcomes (e.g., job dissatisfaction, turnover, depression; Allen, 2012). Moreover, to the extent that child care poses demands in the family domain (Bianchi & Milkie, 2010), the children of employees are important stakeholders in the work-family interface. Yet, the role of employees? children in absorbing the impact or being a source of work-family conflict has received scant attention. Such issues are particularly important to address in families with adolescents. Specifically, work-family conflict creates contexts in which parents have fewer resources or time to monitor their adolescents' whereabouts and activities, likely placing adolescents at high risk for poor psychosocial outcomes (Smetana, 2008). In fact, relative to younger children, adolescents are more likely to display problem behaviors (e.g., depression and substance abuse) that increase parent-adolescent conflict, which may affect parents' time and energy at work. Thus, we propose to address research questions within families who have adolescent children. Specifically, we propose two studies that test both directions of a mediation model informed by the spillover hypothesis of life stressors (Staines, 1980). Based on prior work indicating that parent-adolescent conflict evidences reciprocal relations with children's psychosocial adjustment (Burt et al., 2005), we propose that the reciprocal relations between work-family conflict and adolescent psychosocial maladjustment are mediated by parent-adolescent conflict. Further, our team members have training in not only diverse social science disciplines, but also diverse research settings. Accordingly, we propose two studies that test the model described previously in both field and laboratory settings, allowing each study's strengths to address the limitations of the other study. First, we will test both directions of the above-mentioned mediation model using daily diaries, completed by both parents and adolescents, conducted over a two-week period to measure work-family conflict, parent-adolescent conflict, parental work functioning, and adolescent psychosocial functioning. Second, we will test the same theoretical model using a laboratory design. Specifically, we will recruit family dyads with one full-time working parent and one adolescent for a laboratory study. We will randomly assign each full-time working parent and adolescent dyad to one of three levels of the independent variable: (a) task induction of parental work stress and a low-stress condition for the adolescent, (b) task induction of adolescent psychosocial stress and a low-stress condition for the parent, and (c) both parent and adolescent assigned to a low-stress condition. Next, we will administer a controlled task meant to reflect parent-adolescent conflict (i.e., mediator variable), and we will objectively assess parent and adolescent physiological flexibility (i.e., an index of emotional dysregulation) during this task. We then will administer performance-based tasks of parental work functioning and adolescent psychosocial functioning to test the impact of parent-adolescent conflict on these domains, as well as the cross-domain, indirect impacts of parental work stress and adolescent psychosocial stress. The proposed project promises to improve our basic understanding of the spillover between parents? work experiences and non-work family life."

The infection has also had a profound negative effect on the United States? economy, and it has been estimated that two months of shutdown costs the overall economy over $2 trillion. We are often presented with the difficult choice of either sacrificing the physical health or the financial health of our citizens. This could be a false choice, however, if the nation were able to quickly identify, isolate and treat the specific locations where the virus was most prevalent. Contact tracing is one potential solution to this dilemma. The purpose of this research is to examine the degree to which an organizational redesign intervention centered around collaboration and multiteam systems, accompanied with a new social network-based visualization tool, can increase the speed, accuracy, and meaningfulness of contact tracing work. This would allow a surgical approach to mitigation, instead of a nation-wide shutdown, thus facilitating an adaptive and efficient system that would allow economic activity to take place in locations where there is not an unacceptably high level of threat to public health.  Findings from this project will contribute to both the health and well-being of our society, as well as to our financial recovery and economic competitiveness in the 21st century.  <br/><br/>Contact tracing has been used with diseases such small pox, tuberculosis, measles and HIV, but the nature of Covid-19 often makes the process as traditionally conducted unsuitable due to the infection?s speed and scope. This project studies the adaptation of contract tracing work to these new circumstances. We know that many scientific, business and military organizations seeking to increase their responsiveness have redesigned the nature of work around team-based structures that are flexibly arranged into temporally-bound and reconfigurable multiteam systems. These reconfigurable structures allow organizations to execute tasks that are larger in scale and scope relative to what can be accomplished by individuals working alone or in small teams, but also create opportunities for quick pivots in task execution. This project will examine the impact of this intervention using a staggered cohort research design and social network visualization. The project will sample actual contact tracers, creating 40 15-person multi-team systems. Each multi-team system will include three, five-person virtual teams.  The teams will be provided with a social networking visualization tool that will convert contacts into links or ties. The project will examine the impact of this intervention on the performance of units, teams, supervisors and the tracers themselves. Due to the difficulty of collecting data on (a) large numbers of comparable multiteam systems and (b) the time-sensitive granular social networks, the data generated by this proposal will add critically needed evidence pertaining to the development and deployment of reconfigurable structures, with important implications for organizational theory and for addressing organizational responsiveness in contexts that such as extreme events, including those beyond the current pandemic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

High levels of unemployment, especially among young adults, have led policymakers to advocate credit programs aimed at promoting entrepreneurship.  However, evidence on the overall impacts of such programs has been decidedly mixed, particularly among women.  In light of this evidence, we are conducting a randomized impact evaluation of a new policy intervention:  microfranchising.  The evaluation will measure the impacts of a microfranchising intervention designed specifically for young women. Microfranchising, which connects unemployed participants with businesses via small-scale, multi-person franchises, is a recent policy innovation whose efficacy has not yet been convincingly demonstrated.  By eliminating the need to develop a novel business model, but leaving participants to manage their own time and entrepreneurial effort, microfranchising strikes a middle ground between full entrepreneurship and conventional salaried employment. <br/>Conceptually, a microfranchise has features in common with both a formal sector job and self-employment: while microfranchisees do not need to devise business models of their own, they work with very little managerial supervision and considerable latitude for creativity.  <br/><br/>The proposed project will evaluate the second wave of the Girls Empowered by Microfranchise (GEM) Project.  The evaluation estimates the impact of the microfranchising program on young women's labor supply, income and expenditures, savings, empowerment and self-actualization, and overall well-being.  <br/><br/>A randomized design compares the microfranchising program to both the control group which receives no intervention and the treatment.  Random assignment of applicants to treatment will generate unconfounded estimates of the impact of the program on girls in the treatment group.  To explore potential spillovers, the baseline data collection will include detailed questions on local friendships which allow the PIs to map each girl's social network, and determine the number of friends in the program who were randomly assigned to the treatment group(s).  <br/><br/>The randomized design allows the PIs to credibly estimate the impact of the microfranchising program on participants, generating cleaner evidence of program effects than a non-experimental study could provide.  The design also allows for the estimation of the indirect effects of the program on pre-existing businesses within the treated sectors. <br/><br/>Providing increasing numbers of unemployed and underemployed youth with viable income-generation strategies is a pressing policy priority, particularly in light of the perceived failure of microfinance to live up to its promise as a radical tool for transforming the lives of the poor through entrepreneurship.  Microfranchising provides a potential alternative to  microfinance which relaxes the need to develop a new business model before starting a business.  Thus, the first ever impact evaluation of a randomized microfranchising intervention is likely to be of substantial interest to policymakers and development professionals.  Yet, no rigorous evaluation of a microfranchising program exists.  As a result, this research is likely to have broad policy impacts."

The workshop will examine the central question of how to lead change successfully in the future so that change success rates consistently exceed the widely cited 30-50% range, when compared to objectives set by organizations prior to change. Both global organizational surveys, as well as academic studies, find that organizational change often yields a variety of negative results affecting many segments of society including: budget over-runs conservatively estimated at 134% of the original plan; greatly diminished staff resources that include high stress levels, demanding workloads, and negative emotional reactions; and loss of valuable time with little to no organizational gain in competitiveness, goal achievement or business value.  <br/><br/>The goals of the workshop are to identify, examine, research, discuss, and begin to achieve consensus on:<br/>1) The contextual factors, operating at multiple levels, and affecting the success rates of organizational change, both episodic and continuous;<br/>2) Different roles played by change leadership in initiating, facilitating, implementing, and/or sustaining change<br/>3) Different methods, processes, and styles of leadership making change success likely;<br/>4) The multi-level effects within organizational change and the processes through which these effects impact the success of leading organizational change.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:  This workshop comes at a critical point in research on organizational change. On one hand, a major type of change, episodic change, is described as infrequent, discontinuous, intentional and led from the top down in terms of the organizational hierarchy.  Although this change is occurring more and more frequently, many senior change leaders report serious deficits in their organizations' knowledge and capabilities to enact change successfully.  On the other hand, a second major type of change, continuous change, is believed by many change scholars to possess high potential for improving the quality, innovation and success rate of organizational change. Continuous change is characterized as ongoing, evolving, cumulative, emergent rather than planned, and generally enacted from the bottom up.  Yet to date, there is limited conceptual research on continuous change and virtually no empirical studies to strengthen our understanding of how it develops, the current success rates, and the types of change leadership that are likely to be more or less successful in shaping such change. Thus, this workshop provides a valuable opportunity to enhance and extend our knowledge about factors affecting the success of leading organizational change, both episodic and continuous, and to decrease the negative effects of change that affect many aspects of society. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: This workshop includes expert participants of different academic disciplines, business functional areas, genders, nationalities, and industries. We expect the research and ideas discussed at the workshop to be presented and published in a variety of outlets and media, making them generally available to academic scholars, senior leaders, doctoral students, change managers, professional associations and the public at large. As a result, the workshop will not only advance research but also inform practice about leading organizational change successfully."

COVID-19 directly affects the physical, financial, and psychological well-being of those who live in close proximity to the outbreak areas. Because of its potential threat to physical health, it has widespread effects on the thought processes and behaviors of the global population. This project seeks to understand the impact of COVID-19 by examining how it affects workers? perceptions of the health-related threat, their emotional and motivational reactions towards the threat, and their downstream work-related behaviors. This project will analyze workers? anxiety and desire to make a lasting and meaningful impact to their environment as different reactions towards COVID-19. These reactions, in turn, can lead to different levels of work performance, helping behaviors, and withdrawal from the workplace. Importantly, the project will test if and how the organizational context may play an important role in encouraging effective versus dysfunctional coping among workers when facing threats related to COVID-19. Results from the project will enhance understanding of how workers react to health-related threat information, and how their productivity and well-being may be affected by the information. Results will also equip organizations with knowledge to create a context that will help employees adapt to the threat brought on by COVID-19 or other similar life-threatening crises.  More broadly, this project will clarify how organizations and managers can transform negative crises and challenges into opportunities to boost workforce morale and prosocial motivation. <br/><br/>The goal of the proposed research is to understand the impact of COVID-19 among working adults within the context of the pandemic. The project conceptualizes COVID-19 as a salient mortality cue and will analyze individual employees? adaptive reflection and maladaptive anxiety as responses to this cue. The project will also analyze how reflection may be related to employees? positive coping behaviors such as productivity and helping, whereas anxiety as a maladaptive reaction may be associated with negative behaviors such as withdrawal. Finally, the project will examine the organizational contextual factors that may exacerbate or ameliorate workers? reactions towards the threat of COVID-19. The project will consider organizational health climate, ethical leadership, and corporate social responsibility practices as critical factors that may promote the adaptive reactions towards COVID-19. The project will use time-lagged, three-wave surveys to collect data from working adults; structural equation modeling and conditional indirect effect tests will be employed to evaluate research questions.

While these solutions have merits, they often place the burden of creating more gender inclusive organizations on women themselves. A more effective approach to enhance gender inclusivity is to understand the role that male leaders may play in supporting women's advancement within organizations. While many male leaders may understand the importance of supporting female leaders, they may not know how to effectively do so. This proposal seeks to identify effective behaviors of male champions for female leadership and for supporting gender equality in organizations.

First, we will conduct a qualitative study, which utilizes interviews with male champions and those who have been supported by male champions, to determine key gender inclusive leadership behaviors. Themes derived from the interviews will be used to generate a quantitative measure of gender inclusive behaviors among male leaders. Second, we will conduct a quantitative study to examine the relationship between gender inclusive leader behaviors and workplace outcomes. Effects of top-level leaders' gender inclusive behaviors on their direct reports attitudes and performance will be examined using multi-source, multi-level data. Finally, we will conduct an in-depth case study of a best practices company for gender inclusive leadership.

Indeed, African American and Hispanic people comprise less than 10% of the STEM workforce. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to increase the recruitment, retention, and preparation of Hispanic and African American students for STEM careers. We focus on the subtle yet significant messages that minority students encounter in STEM contexts that undermine their success. We uniquely consider the ways that allies, or majority group members who strive to end oppression toward, and advocate on behalf of, minority group members, can effectively address subtle discrimination, and thus ultimately support the STEM interest, efficacy, achievement, and workplace success of minority students. In summary, the findings from this work will serve as an impetus for scholarship on minority stress interventions and ally engagement. Additionally, it will offer immediately applicable strategies for retaining African American and Hispanic students in STEM, a necessary step for increasing the representation of racial minorities in the U.S. STEM workforce.<br/><br/>This research pursues the overarching goal of developing and testing strategies that enhance the retention of African American and Hispanic students in STEM careers by identifying and evaluating ally behaviors that reduce the detrimental consequences of subtle discrimination. One explanation for this shortage is the subtle differences in students' formative college experiences. In so doing, we build and test a conceptual model that uniquely integrates attributional ambiguity and stress and coping theories with emerging insights about the influence of allies. We advance robust logic based on evidence from the fields related to the organizational science to propose that the ambiguity of subtle discrimination depletes cognitive and affective resources necessary for achievement in STEM. This reasoning reflects the first thorough analysis of why and how subtle discrimination is problematic and points directly to ambiguity reduction strategies as powerful theory-driven buffers of these effects. We blend complementary methods of experience sampling and laboratory experiment to build theoretically meaningful and practically useful knowledge. This work will provide specific, evidence-based strategies to support African American and Hispanic college students, thereby enhancing their STEM interest, efficacy, motivation, achievement, and ultimately career choice and success in organizations. In particular, we focus on the previously unexamined role of motivated observers--allies--in reducing the consequences of subtle discrimination for its targets and thus catalyze new diversity science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While many of the existing studies on workplace discrimination have focused on the individual or the organization, we argue that teams play an overlooked role in women's experiences in engineering. Taking a team-centric approach, we examine interpersonal discrimination and its multi-level ripple impact on both individual and team outcomes. <br/><br/>The current project is designed to complete three high-level objectives. Our first objective is to identify whether and how engineering team experiences differ by gender, specifically in relation to team discrimination. As a second objective, we will examine the effect team discrimination has on engineering team outcomes (e.g., performance, creativity). Finally, our third objective is to examine the impact team discrimination has on individual-level outcomes and specifically the career trajectory of female engineers. To effectively carry out the stated objectives, we will use complementary methods to conduct two primary studies. We will begin with a multilevel, longitudinal examination of discrimination in STEM teams, specifically in relation to female team members. This first study will address the concern regarding a lack of longitudinal, team-level data and provide insight regarding an understudied phenomenon, team discrimination. We follow with an experience sampling study examining team discrimination toward females working within the STEM field and the effects of such occurrences throughout their daily lives and long-term career aspirations and decisions. The culmination of this program will provide a greater understanding of how team experiences shape the career path for women in STEM, with the overall goal of retaining women in STEM careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, processes of conducting volunteer flood rescues, factors that affect immediate decision-making during rescues, decisions about volunteer group development, and use of social media for rescuing and group development will be researched through intense interviewing and participation with rescuers. Disasters are unique opportunities to study social processes, and they are also becoming more frequent social problems.  Disasters of recent years have introduced volunteer organizations supported by social media and new technologies. Limited scholarly research has studied this volunteer rescue movement, these volunteers, or these rescue operations. Findings will contribute to scholarly understanding of group formation and development and how this may be affected by new technologies.  They also will contribute to public welfare by being integrated in courses such as on emergency management and hazard mitigation and recovery, and by being directly shared with organizations that do rescues as well as the broader emergency management and public communities.<br/><br/>To address the research goal, ethnographic research will be conducted that includes participation with volunteer organizations that conduct rescues, 20-40 interviews with emergency management officials, 30-60 interviews with volunteer rescuers, and 20-30 interviews with persons rescued by civilian volunteers. Over the life of the project, this will involve training and traveling with volunteer organizations as they respond to disasters, such as the three to which these organizations responded in 2018, Hurricanes Florence and Michael and floods in Southeast Texas.  Participation will be in three different roles: boat rescuer, dispatcher, and leadership coordination. In addition, available social media data and media articles will be collected and analyzed inductively.

Although some research has been conducted on these issues in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) departments, little knowledge has transferred over to professional schools and other disciplines, which play a key role in economic growth, such as in ""big data"" and entrepreneurial jobs. Addressing these gaps, this workshop will gather interdisciplinary experts to discuss the state of organizational science regarding gender equality, career success, and work-life inclusion in business schools and understudied contexts. The results of the workshop will help advance gender diversity, and women?s and minorities' career success in universities, business, and society by identifying scientific gaps, prioritizing studies; and addressing an under-researched critical area of organizational science. The research agenda developed will encourage future interdisciplinary scholarship on gender equality and work-life inclusion that can help policymakers to engage in evidence-based practices. New insights will be fostered on the organizational science regarding how to foster more gender and work-life inclusive businesses and universities and will advance scientific knowledge on strategies enhancing the attraction, advancement, retention, and career longevity of women faculty; and addressing societal inequality. The workshop products include a website and publications that will be disseminated to the public and policymakers. This workshop addresses a critical national policy area related to increasing labor market equality for women and minorities. <br/><br/>Despite growing scientific attention to advancing women and minorities in universities generally, and in professional schools specifically, the gender and related work-life inclusion picture remains bleak. Addressing gender inequality requires greater dual scientific inquiry into the science of organizations involving the more effective implementation of formal work-life policies such as extending the tenure clock or dual career hire incentives, and the creation of ""work-life inclusive climates."" A work-life inclusive climate is defined as one where a faculty member would not feel s/he would have to sacrifice their family and non-work identities in order to succeed in the job role. The goals of this interdisciplinary workshop is (1) to assess work-life and career issues and linkages to faculty gender inclusion and diversity in business schools and understudied contexts from an organizational science perspective; (2) to define the scientific terrain of faculty gender and work-life inclusion and intersectionality linkages; (3) to increase knowledge of the science of fostering gender, work-life inclusion, career success and organizational change in understudied faculty contexts; and (4) to foster interdisciplinary conversation with thought leaders, researchers and exemplary key decision-makers in order to identify scientific antecedents, outcomes and future research gaps.

Given such a broad domain, a huge fraction of economic activity, as well as much political and social activity, is undertaken as organized activity. One might think, then, that academics would be actively studying the science of organizations and their effectiveness. To some extent, this is true, but the field is badly fragmented: different disciplines operate mostly in isolation; many professional schools focus on only their own kind of organization (e.g., hospitals, schools, public agencies, businesses). Meanwhile, social-science departments often regard the science of organizations as outside their purview, yet doctoral training in professional schools sometimes lacks the depth available in social-science departments. To better respond to this situation, this project convenes a series of workshops and multi-disciplinary collaborations to advance the science of organizations and imagine its future directions. <br/>These workshops will engage the network and expertise already shaped by the four Summer Institutes on ?Organizations and Their Effectiveness? at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (CASBS) at Stanford University, co-directed by Robert Gibbons (MIT) and Woody Powell (Stanford University). This network includes young, problem-solving scholars researching organizational effectiveness from a wide range of disciplines (e.g., communications, economics, education, management, political science, public policy, social psychology, and sociology) and in the contexts of very different kinds of organizations (e.g, firms, government agencies, hospitals, courts, churches, schools, police departments, and social movements). This group is well positioned not only to help imagine but also to help implement the future of the science of organizations. Participants will be assigned into small, multi-disciplinary teams and presented with the question of how NSF might continue to advance and fund the science of organization. The teams will discuss the ecosystem of research funding for organizational science, including government agencies such as the NSF, major foundations and philanthropies, and university centers. After identifying areas of consensus and disagreement, participants will collaborate on strategies that warrant further elaboration and synthesize these recommendations. In this way, these workshops seek two related objectives: to enlist young experts in imagining the future of the science of organizations; and to cultivate potential leaders and collaborators in implementing this future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We know that complexity is influenced by the way work is organized, but current theory and methods do not provide useful ways to examine this relationship.  This research will develop and test new methods for analyzing the complexity of healthcare routines using electronic medical records (EMR) and interviews from a range of clinical specialties at the University of Rochester Medical Center, including Dermatology, Dermatologic Surgery, Orthopedics, Pediatric Oncology, and Radiation Oncology.  This research will deepen our understanding of the factors that drive the complexity of healthcare organizations, a context where there is an urgent need for better ways of organizing. This project will provide a way to analyze the complexity of healthcare routines, and better understand complexity as a factor in the cost and quality of healthcare.<br/><br/>Complexity is a basic concept in the science of organization, and routines are the fundamental way that organizations accomplish work. However, the state of the art in organizational science currently provides no valid, reliable way to measure or compare their complexity. This research will demonstrate a novel, graph-theoretic methodology that incorporates social and material dimensions into the portrayal of routines. This methodology can be used to assess and compare the influence of various antecedents on the complexity of clinical routines. This project will also result in new research infrastructure, in the form of algorithms and software that can be applied in future research on any kind of process or routine. This new research infrastructure is particularly timely and valuable because of the increasing availability of digital trace data, such as the electronic medical record data used here."

Despite their importance, prior research has paid limited attention to the nonwork domain, including family, community, and personal life, contexts that are antecedents and consequences of leadership role occupancy, leadership development, and day-to-day variation of leadership behaviors. This project takes a life-span and holistic approach to analyze how nonwork domain variables, such as community involvement and volunteering activities, lead to and are shaped by leadership role occupancy. Further, the project provides critical insights on how nonwork domain experiences might promote leadership development and how leadership development might contribute to leaders? growth and thriving in other nonwork domains. Lastly, the project will help to uncover how and when leaders? day-to-day behaviors and their nonwork domain experiences mutually influence each other. These findings will inform business organizations seeking to promote leadership to facilitate their economic competitiveness, and will also inform society regarding how leadership in one context may contribute to the welfare of organizations more generally.<br/><br/>We know very little regarding how leadership in one organizational context may influence leadership and work behavior more generally, or the reciprocal relationships between leadership in multiple domains.  Adopting a multi-method approach, this project will conduct three empirical studies. First, the project will use archival data (National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, NLSY) collected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (NLSY 79, NLSY 79 Children and Young Adults, and NLSY 97) to examine how individuals? nonwork experiences and their leadership role occupancy at work influence each other reciprocally. The project will use mixture latent Markov modeling to capture and predict the leadership role transition patterns. Second, the project will use a longitudinal design collecting multi-wave, multi-source data to examine the interplay between leaders? nonwork experiences and their leadership development processes using latent change score models.  The third study takes a within-person perspective and analyzes how leaders? work and nonwork experiences and behaviors are interconnected on a daily basis. The project will conduct an experience sampling study over 10 consecutive days, capturing fluctuations of leaders? work and nonwork behaviors and experiences that are otherwise missed by surveys separated by longer time intervals; it will use dynamic structural equation modeling (DSEM) in data analysis. Lastly, by triangulating findings of three studies using different methods, the project will promote a more comprehensive understanding of how leaders? work and nonwork experience affect each other across different time frames and life stages.  Findings from the project will inform organizational theories regarding leadership, as well as life course perspectives that focus on the interplay between work and non-work domains, especially regarding leadership.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To prime the development of such a literature, this workshop ? Understanding Accelerators as Organizations that Influence Diversity and Inclusion in Entrepreneurship ? will convene faculty researchers and graduate students in organization science and entrepreneurship as well as practitioners who facilitate accelerators. Once assembled, participants will set forth an agenda for future research that will advance theories of organization about accelerators while attending to issues of relevance in practice. The output from the gathering will be shared widely to stimulate awareness about the need for greater diversity and inclusion in the entrepreneurial ecosystem and the means by which scholars and practitioners can collaborate on rigorous and relevant research. Moreover, the workshop aims to be the beginning of an ongoing community of shared interest that can continue to move forward scholarship on entrepreneurship and diversity over time.<br/><br/>In recent decades, studies of science education have shifted the expectations for diversity and inclusion contexts for learning about Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). Despite the overlap between STEM and HTHG entrepreneurship, only limited insights have transferred from informal STEM learning contexts to accelerators. Starting with these gaps, this workshop will highlight what is known (and what needs to be known) about accelerators as organizations and their impact on matters of diversity and inclusion in HTHG entrepreneurship. The developed research agenda will encourage interdisciplinary scholarship on matters of diversity and inclusion in contexts for entrepreneurship education. New insights stand to be fostered in organizational science regarding how to support greater diversity and inclusion in accelerators as well as in adjacent activity settings such as universities with formal entrepreneurship programs and businesses in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. These insights will advance scientific knowledge on the role that the processes and practices of accelerators have on the initial involvement and career trajectories of entrepreneurs from non-dominant population groups (including women, people of color, people from working class backgrounds, and people from rural communities), thereby promoting greater equity in the innovation economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The micro perspective focuses on examining the effects of individual characteristics such as personality, goal orientation, values, thinking styles, motivation and affects, and team characteristics such as team structure and composition, team climate and process. The macro perspective focuses on examining the effects of industry conditions such as market structure and firms' characteristics such as size and network position on firm innovation. This disconnected approach has resulted in divergent or even conflicting business practices and research findings, leading to fragmented understandings of the phenomena. Some important questions that are of interest to researchers, policy makers, and business owners and managers remain unanswered. The current research project integrates literatures from multiple disciplines including strategy, psychology, human resource management (HRM) and organizational behavior, and develops a multilevel framework of creativity and innovation. Specifically, this research, using data collected from two research sites, examines the following questions: First, within and across industries, how do top managers of a firm make sense of the external environment and make decisions on creativity and innovation? Second, how can firms cultivate an innovative internal environment within the organization to facilitate creativity and innovation? Third, what factors shape the external and internal environments critical for creativity and innovation in start-up firms? <br/><br/>This research offers a number of theoretical, methodological, and practical contributions to the field of creativity and innovation. Theoretically, the multilevel approach helps bridge the ""micro-macro"" divide and provides a concerted picture of how factors from different levels of analysis may jointly shape the external and internal environments supportive for creativity and innovation, and delineate the boundary conditions for such processes. Methodologically, using both qualitative and quantitative data from two important research sites obtained through three phases of data collection (interviews/ observations, surveys, and field experiments), the research design provides findings that are not only of strong external and internal validity, but also contribute to the discovery of new theories. Practically, this research bridges the ""research-practice"" divide, enhances ""evidence-based management"", and helps government policy makers and organizational management better design and implement policies and practices that are conducive to creativity and innovation."

As a result of this work-family conflict, a parent may experience low morale at work, stress, and depression, all of which have profound effects on their work engagement and productivity. Such tension between work and family may potentially impact the home environment as well, including negative effects on how adolescent children in the family think, feel, and behave. However, we know little about these effects, and also whether a negative home environment may have similarly negative effects on parents at work. Our project seeks to study work-family conflict and its effects on the home environment (and vice versa) using controlled laboratory methods, and methods that allow for the study of these factors in ""real-life"" outside of the laboratory. By understanding the ways in which work-family conflict and the home environment influence each other, we may gain a better understanding of how to improve functioning in both work and home domain, and thus increase parents' work engagement and productivity.     <br/><br/>Many employees in the U.S. experience high demands to fulfill obligations both at work and at home (Galinsky et al. 2009). The incompatibility of heightened pressure from both work and home is referred to as work-family conflict (Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985), high levels of which place employees at increased risk for a host of poor work and psychosocial outcomes (e.g., job dissatisfaction, turnover, depression; Allen, 2012). Moreover, to the extent that child care poses demands in the family domain (Bianchi & Milkie, 2010), the children of employees are important stakeholders in the work-family interface. Yet, the role of employees? children in absorbing the impact or being a source of work-family conflict has received scant attention. Such issues are particularly important to address in families with adolescents. Specifically, work-family conflict creates contexts in which parents have fewer resources or time to monitor their adolescents' whereabouts and activities, likely placing adolescents at high risk for poor psychosocial outcomes (Smetana, 2008). In fact, relative to younger children, adolescents are more likely to display problem behaviors (e.g., depression and substance abuse) that increase parent-adolescent conflict, which may affect parents' time and energy at work. Thus, we propose to address research questions within families who have adolescent children. Specifically, we propose two studies that test both directions of a mediation model informed by the spillover hypothesis of life stressors (Staines, 1980). Based on prior work indicating that parent-adolescent conflict evidences reciprocal relations with children's psychosocial adjustment (Burt et al., 2005), we propose that the reciprocal relations between work-family conflict and adolescent psychosocial maladjustment are mediated by parent-adolescent conflict. Further, our team members have training in not only diverse social science disciplines, but also diverse research settings. Accordingly, we propose two studies that test the model described previously in both field and laboratory settings, allowing each study's strengths to address the limitations of the other study. First, we will test both directions of the above-mentioned mediation model using daily diaries, completed by both parents and adolescents, conducted over a two-week period to measure work-family conflict, parent-adolescent conflict, parental work functioning, and adolescent psychosocial functioning. Second, we will test the same theoretical model using a laboratory design. Specifically, we will recruit family dyads with one full-time working parent and one adolescent for a laboratory study. We will randomly assign each full-time working parent and adolescent dyad to one of three levels of the independent variable: (a) task induction of parental work stress and a low-stress condition for the adolescent, (b) task induction of adolescent psychosocial stress and a low-stress condition for the parent, and (c) both parent and adolescent assigned to a low-stress condition. Next, we will administer a controlled task meant to reflect parent-adolescent conflict (i.e., mediator variable), and we will objectively assess parent and adolescent physiological flexibility (i.e., an index of emotional dysregulation) during this task. We then will administer performance-based tasks of parental work functioning and adolescent psychosocial functioning to test the impact of parent-adolescent conflict on these domains, as well as the cross-domain, indirect impacts of parental work stress and adolescent psychosocial stress. The proposed project promises to improve our basic understanding of the spillover between parents? work experiences and non-work family life."

Research has shown that negative emotional reactions can impair employees? task performance and result in counterproductive work behavior and, in severe cases, insider threat behavior. Much of this research has been guided by theories predicting causal event-emotion-behavior sequences. However, the many empirical studies in this area are either correlational rather than causal (e.g., ecological momentary assessment studies) or conducted in the laboratory rather than in situ. This research will help employees gain strategies to regulate their emotions, thereby potentially improving task performance and deterring counterproductive and insider threat behavior. Thus, the research has the potential to improve employee well-being. The research also has the potential to aid organizations in weakening the links between stressful events and insider threat behavior on the part of their employees. Finally, this research will illustrate the JITAI as a new and very different type of intervention that can fruitfully augment traditional interventions in a variety of topic areas within the organizational sciences (e.g., occupational safety interventions, sexual harassment prevention interventions, leader development interventions, and technical skills training interventions).<br/><br/><br/>The current pair of studies will manipulate emotional experience via randomly assigned Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs), also known as ecological momentary interventions. Tailored interventions are needed to help individuals regulate negative emotions in the moment?when most needed and before the resulting deleterious performance outcomes manifest. As such, the JITAIs in the current research are focused on emotion regulation, thereby providing causal tests of the role of emotion on behavior as well as testing additional research questions involving situational and dispositional moderators of emotion-behavior relationships. Unlike standard interventions, these JITAIs are within-person interventions that capitalize on temporal states of vulnerability (e.g., high levels of negative emotion) and aspects of the current context (e.g., the nature of the emotion-causing episode, the feasibility of completing the intervention at that particular moment) to optimize treatment effectiveness. Specifically, in the proposed studies, participants will repeatedly be randomly (re-)assigned to different cognitively-focused emotion reappraisal interventions or to no intervention (control condition) over the course of several work weeks. The reappraisal strategies to be contrasted against each other (and against a control condition) include imagining that a negative emotional stimulus or situation had a positive outcome, altering the impact of the emotional stimulus by adopting a more-or-less objective perspective, and interpreting the focal emotion in a manner that facilitates an accepting, observing, non-judgmental relationship to emotions. The first study is a micro-randomized trial that will provide for causal inferences regarding emotion and the effects of three cognitive reappraisal JITAIs in achieving proximal (i.e., decision-point and day level) emotion and performance outcomes. The results from the first study will permit the optimization of decision rules (e.g., dropping a less effective intervention, including decision rules for which intervention should be used when based on context) to inform the second study. The second study is a randomized control trial that will evaluate the effectiveness of the JITAIs in achieving distal (i.e., end-of-study and post-study) outcomes against control conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Meanwhile, GBA vendors have developed their own approaches to GBA with little guidance from researchers, sometimes creating biased and otherwise problematic assessments that are currently in use within the US education system, the hiring and promotion processes for US businesses, and the US military.  Thus, the purpose of this workshop is to bring both researchers and vendors across applications domains together to create a roadmap for future research, to integrate knowledge across disciplines, and to connect researchers and vendors directly to facilitate basic research using real-world GBAs. We therefore recognize GBAs as a prime area reflecting two of NSF's ""Big Ideas"": Growing Convergence research in the context of the Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier.   By bringing these fields together, we will create a research roadmap to better assess the complex KSAOs needed as work continues to evolve.<br/><br/>We currently lack an integrative theoretical understanding or empirical evidence of the various cost-benefit trade-offs inherent to GBAs versus traditional measurement approaches, across relevant disciplines.  There are two primary trade-offs commonly cited: 1) broader and more responsive KSAO measurement at the expense of focused measurement and 2) improved overall assessment utility despite increased development cost.  Development of engaging and psychometrically meaningful GBAs to overcome these problems is more complex and multidimensional than survey development because prototype development requires large teams with diverse multidisciplinary expertise, yet researchers generally remain in tightly-defined disciplinary silos, developing parallel research literatures on GBA despite a general recognition of how this slows theory development. We aim to break across these disciplinary barriers with this workshop, to take the first steps towards an integrated research literature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to encourage female leaders, many companies leverage diversity training initiatives or women-centered solutions, such as women's networking groups or leadership training. While these solutions have merits, they often place the burden of creating more gender inclusive organizations on women themselves. A more effective approach to enhance gender inclusivity is to understand the role that male leaders may play in supporting women's advancement within organizations. While many male leaders may understand the importance of supporting female leaders, they may not know how to effectively do so. This proposal seeks to identify effective behaviors of male champions for female leadership and for supporting gender equality in organizations. This research highlights ways in which males can contribute to gender inclusivity at work. Results from this project can inform organizations about how to influence, train, and encourage possible male champions to actively support female leadership in the workplace. <br/><br/>Male champions, or male leaders who value diversity in the workplace and support advancing talented females to leader positions, have a critical role to play as agents of change to enhance gender equality. The purpose of this project is to identify the effective behaviors of male champions. Multiple studies that utilize different research designs and methods will be conducted to examine these behaviors. First, we will conduct a qualitative study, which utilizes interviews with male champions and those who have been supported by male champions, to determine key gender inclusive leadership behaviors. Themes derived from the interviews will be used to generate a quantitative measure of gender inclusive behaviors among male leaders. Second, we will conduct a quantitative study to examine the relationship between gender inclusive leader behaviors and workplace outcomes. Effects of top-level leaders' gender inclusive behaviors on their direct reports attitudes and performance will be examined using multi-source, multi-level data. Finally, we will conduct an in-depth case study of a best practices company for gender inclusive leadership. This study will utilize observational data and in-depth interviews with high level leaders and their direct reports to better understand the processes through which male champion behaviors create gender inclusive workplace cultures. Results of this research can benefit workers and their organizations by enhancing our understanding of factors contributing to gender equality in organizations."

Indeed, African American and Hispanic people comprise less than 10% of the STEM workforce. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to increase the recruitment, retention, and preparation of Hispanic and African American students for STEM careers. We focus on the subtle yet significant messages that minority students encounter in STEM contexts that undermine their success. We uniquely consider the ways that allies, or majority group members who strive to end oppression toward, and advocate on behalf of, minority group members, can effectively address subtle discrimination, and thus ultimately support the STEM interest, efficacy, achievement, and workplace success of minority students. In summary, the findings from this work will serve as an impetus for scholarship on minority stress interventions and ally engagement. Additionally, it will offer immediately applicable strategies for retaining African American and Hispanic students in STEM, a necessary step for increasing the representation of racial minorities in the U.S. STEM workforce.<br/><br/>This research pursues the overarching goal of developing and testing strategies that enhance the retention of African American and Hispanic students in STEM careers by identifying and evaluating ally behaviors that reduce the detrimental consequences of subtle discrimination. One explanation for this shortage is the subtle differences in students' formative college experiences. In so doing, we build and test a conceptual model that uniquely integrates attributional ambiguity and stress and coping theories with emerging insights about the influence of allies. We advance robust logic based on evidence from the fields related to the organizational science to propose that the ambiguity of subtle discrimination depletes cognitive and affective resources necessary for achievement in STEM. This reasoning reflects the first thorough analysis of why and how subtle discrimination is problematic and points directly to ambiguity reduction strategies as powerful theory-driven buffers of these effects. We blend complementary methods of experience sampling and laboratory experiment to build theoretically meaningful and practically useful knowledge. This work will provide specific, evidence-based strategies to support African American and Hispanic college students, thereby enhancing their STEM interest, efficacy, motivation, achievement, and ultimately career choice and success in organizations. In particular, we focus on the previously unexamined role of motivated observers--allies--in reducing the consequences of subtle discrimination for its targets and thus catalyze new diversity science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This applies to law enforcement agencies as much as officers. For agencies, body worn cameras represent a novel piece of equipment that must be supported through appropriate technological systems and usage policies. Cameras also produce an abundance of video data that policing organizations must manage as well. Considering these demands, this project will identify the impacts of body worn camera technologies on individual work dynamics and organizational operations in US police departments. Specifically, this project will develop a larger IT governance framework to maximize the value of body worn camera technologies for effective policing operations. This project will expand knowledge on the management of public sector organizations that are increasingly enmeshed with wearable Internet of Things technologies like body worn cameras, and research results will inform the development of educational materials in technology management, law and criminology, and information systems. <br/><br/>A primary goal of this project is to create an evidence-based organization theory and IT governance framework for public sector organizations that are being increasingly embedded with digital technologies in general and Internet of Things technologies in particular. Specific to the impacts of body worn cameras (BWC) on policing organizations, this project addresses three questions: (1) What individual work dynamics and organizational changes are induced by BWC systems; (2) what technosocial governance mechanisms help maximize the value of BWCs in accomplishing police departments' mission; and (3) what empirical evidence explains the effects of BWCs on the operational and mission performance of police departments. This research activity answers these questions through a three-stage research design. First, the investigators will complete qualitative case studies of police agencies by analyzing data collected from interviews, field observations, and document analyses. Second, drawing upon the results of the case studies and in collaboration with participating agencies, the investigators will develop an IT governance framework to maximize the value of body worn camera technologies in accomplishing police departments' missions. Lastly, drawing from data that will be collected through survey and public sources, the investigators will analyze the effect of body worn cameras on the operational and mission performance of police departments across the US."

To facilitate the development of such a literature, the proposed workshop will bring together researchers, practitioners, and policymakers in organizational science and cybersecurity. This workshop will facilitate interdisciplinary integration by: (1) targeting leading experts in core organizational science topic areas who also have interests in cybersecurity; (2) connecting these experts to cybersecurity researchers, practitioners, and policymakers who also have interests in organizational science; (3) hosting presentations at the intersection of organizational science and cybersecurity; (4) breaking through disciplinary barriers to knowledge generation; and (5) developing a concrete agenda for future research. Space in the workshop will be reserved for graduate students from groups underrepresented in cybersecurity and the organizational sciences. To build the overall research capacity of the community, space will also be reserved for faculty from local, non-research-intensive universities. These products from the workshop will be disseminated to a wide variety of stakeholders, so as to inform public policy and enhance national security.<br/><br/>The proposed interdisciplinary workshop addresses the human aspect of cybersecurity in organizational settings, focusing both on employees with cybersecurity-relevant jobs (e.g., analysts working in Security Operations Centers) and the end-users of technology (i.e., essentially all employees in the organization). Workshop attendees will include organizational science researchers and practitioners who study topics relevant to cybersecurity at the micro (e.g., individual employee or end-user), meso (e.g., team or multiteam system), and macro (e.g., organization or country) levels of analysis, along with cybersecurity researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. The absence of direct communication between the organizational sciences and cybersecurity has arguably harmed both fields, and so the workshop will focus on cross-pollination, identification of roadblocks, and the joint development of a future agenda. To that end, the workshop will include keynote presentations (targeted at various levels of analysis), interdisciplinary reactions to keynote presentations, panel discussions, information sharing exercises, breakout groups on specific interdisciplinary topics (e.g., insider threat, collaboration in multiteam systems), and semi-structured networking opportunities. The workshop aims to identify and overcome barriers to collaboration between the organizational sciences and cybersecurity, identify avenues for external funding as well as various publication outlets for research at the intersection of the two disciplines (e.g., high-impact organizational science journals, high-impact cybersecurity journals, ?translational? outlets aimed at disseminating organizational science research to cybersecurity policymakers and managers), and develop a concrete agenda for future interdisciplinary research. Deliverables from the workshop will include: (1) a website containing the workshop program, speakers? (and other attendees?) names and biographical information, background reading on the organizational sciences and cybersecurity, and copies of workshop presentations; (2) an overall technical report (also made available on the workshop website) delineating the conclusions, recommendations, and research agenda generated during the workshop; and (3) a press release and a flier containing information and a link to the overall report."

Urban sustainability is an exemplar of issues which cut across numerous responsibilities traditionally held by distinct units within a single government organization. This research examines the relationship between municipal governments? administrative arrangements, their policy adoption and implementation choices, and sustainability outcomes. It highlights the role of lead unit cross-functional authority?which we define as the clout that an initiative?s administrative lead has over other relevant units in the city government?and assesses its impact on local sustainability outcomes. In so doing, this research contributes to an evidence-based understanding of how public organizations function in order to enhance their design, management, and overall effectiveness.<br/><br/>This work advances convergence research drawing from organizational, policy, sustainable urban systems, and network science to increase the precision and robustness of the Functional Collective Action (FCA) framework. It provides important insight into the determinants of lead agency cross-functional authority?which extant research has highlighted as fundamental but inadequately operationalized?and its influence on policy outcome. Using urban sustainability as our policy lens, we employ a mixed-methods approach to collect and analyze data from focus groups of local government officials, public and private archival repositories, and a nationwide survey to: (a) develop a refined conceptualization and empirical measure of cross-functional authority that captures its various dimensions and mechanisms of influence; (b) develop a comprehensive national dataset of multiple sustainability outcome measures that are comparable across cities; and (c) create the first longitudinal database on local sustainability policies spanning a ten year period, which is often considered the minimum amount of time necessary for nuanced examination of policy implementation and policy change.

Yet, we still struggle with how to manage them in many ways. One issue may be that they are all unique, not only in the tasks they are assembled to perform but also in the skills members have available to compose and facilitate specific team processes. In previous literature, team member skills are typically characterized as either task-related (often assumed to be functional expertise) or interpersonal skills. While all of these skills are important they do not completely describe, nor adequately define, the variety of skills that a member can apply to the team's task and processes. Identifying what these other skills are is far more difficult than identifying what they are not. For the purposes of this proposal, we characterize them as skills, because it is the term most often used to describe what team members bring to the team. More specifically, we label them operational skills because in team operations comprise a myriad of processes that convert inputs into outputs and applying different operations results in different team outputs. Just as team members have unique task-related skills they bring to the team, they may also possess different operational skills that can be applied to the team's task. As such, team task results may be dependent upon which member's skills are applied to what team processes. The purpose of this proposed research, therefore, is to develop and test a taxonomy of team member operational skills that facilitates forward progress on the team's task. In particular, this project's objectives are to (1) determine the operational skills needed in a team domain, (2) determine whether operational skills can be useful in configuring teams, and (3) examine whether an explicit focus on aligning operational skills and task activities facilitates more effective team processes and performance. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The proposed project represents a rigorous, systemic approach to develop a taxonomy of operational skills that team members need to successfully complete their projects. Operational skills refer to team members' abilities to organize, synthesize, and decide in the team context. Scholarly and trade publications allude to the need for these types of meso-level skills (e.g., problem solving skills, decision making skills, management skills) but do not clearly describe or define them. To ensure a comprehensive examination of these skills, input will be extracted from the field in at least two significantly different sectors (e.g., healthcare and shipbuilding) and from controlled environments (i.e., gaming and laboratory). The results of this study will have a transformative impact in that they will (1) provide a theoretical basis for examining how operational skills are used to configure teams, assign tasks, and enhance performance and (2) formalize the incorporation of operational skills into team planning activities.  <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Successful completion of the proposed research will provide clear explication of an additional set of necessary skills team members possess in the form of a taxonomy of operational skills. This taxonomy will enhance future research efforts by, for example, the inclusion of heretofore overlooked, or poorly specified, skills in studies of teams, more comprehensive examinations of the broad array of skills team members possess, and questionnaire scales grounded in this systematic research. Practice may also reap benefit from the results of this research through an introduction to a more nuanced approach to team staffing, as well as new opportunities for recruiting individuals with these skills and training programs that help employees enhance these skills. In the long term, the proposed research has the potential to be the foundation of a new paradigm for considering how teams are configured and task work is assigned, thereby transforming collaborative processes in teams and improving their performance. The proposed study will include students, particularly women and minority students, on the research team."

It is becoming increasingly important, therefore, to understand how to improve the performance of these groups.  The work proposed here will use a new measure of generalized group effectiveness -- called ""collective intelligence"" -- to help do this.  <br/><br/>Building on previous work by the investigators, the project will first develop an online test for collective intelligence.  Then it will compare the results of online and face-to-face groups taking this new test with previous results for groups taking an offline version of the test.  This will help clarify the degree to which online and off-line groups differ in their general effectiveness on a wide range of different tasks.  Next the project will use this test to systematically measure the collective intelligence of online groups that range in size from 2 to 20 people.  This will lay the foundation for exploring whether larger online groups can take advantage of the increased resources that more people bring, without suffering as much from the process losses that usually accompany increased group size in face-to-face groups.  Finally, the project will systematically measure the collective intelligence of online groups with varying proportions of women.  In doing so, the project will also test one particularly promising explanation for a gender effect on group performance:  that groups with more women are less interpersonally competitive, and that this lower intra-group competitiveness leads to higher collective intelligence. <br/><br/>While there have been decades of research on factors that affect the performance of groups, almost all these studies have each focused on a single task.  Thus, strictly speaking, the lessons to be learned from this previous work are limited to the specific tasks studied.  The work proposed here uses the perspective of collective intelligence to investigate, not just the ability of a group to perform a single task, but the group?s general ability to perform a wide range of tasks.  Since many real-world groups must cope with a wide range of problems, just such a perspective may be needed to systematically predict their performance.  In addition, the approach developed here can provide a significant economy of effort in evaluating potential ways of improving online group effectiveness.  Instead of testing interventions on many different specific tasks, researchers will be able to test the interventions once with this general measure, and then have some basis for predicting the effects of the intervention on many other tasks.  By making an online test of collective intelligence available to other researchers, the project will help advance scientific practice in this area.  More generally, by providing a firmer scientific foundation for measuring and improving the performance of groups, the project may help our society address many of its most important problems more effectively.  For instance, with the right kinds of collaboration tools, online groups may be able to be much more effective than face-to-face groups, taking advantage of the simultaneous efforts of far more people without the coordination losses that usually occur in larger groups.  And understanding the dynamics of gender diversity may help us to improve the collaboration of the groups in which both men and women work, by giving everyone?s best ideas a better chance to be heard. And perhaps, someday, this will help create groups that are more collectively intelligent than any groups have ever been before."

Most financial-economic studies of global capital agree on the positive effects of opening a country's stock market to foreign investors. But political economists and sociologists emphasize countries? institutional configurations and local variation that often constrain, weaken, and even disable the benefits of economic globalization. The investigators call for a more balanced perspective on global capital by integrating these two theoretical accounts. Three datasets on China's publicly-traded firms are combined: the WindDB dataset covering these firms' financial information, and the China Center for Economics Research (CCER) and the Chinese Securities Markets and Accounting Research (CSMAR) datasets detailing organizational information. The resulting dataset provides company-by-year observations from 1994 till 2011. Acknowledging that quantitative analysis may not capture sufficient empirical details about how processes work, the investigators will conduct case-studies of 9-12 firms as supplementary data. <br/><br/>In terms of broader impacts, this research contributes to the thriving interdisciplinary literature on the institutions of corporate governance around the world. In recent years, China has deepened its integration into the global market and developed its corporate governance regime. But the Chinese model of corporate setting where state entities are dominating and controlling shareholders is not well understood.

However, the implementation and diffusion of CI-enabled science -- and especially the adoption of advanced CDS&E tools -- is not well understood.  These next-generation technologies are dynamic to an unprecedented degree, in that they are user-driven, custom-made, produced on demand, and ""permanently beta.""

The project employs a grounded-theory approach, to analyze interview data about the emergence of advanced CDS&E tools, and to construct a theoretical framework for understanding dynamic innovation development, use, adoption, implementation, and diffusion within CDS&E VOs. The project's empirical focus will be the NSF-funded Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE; https://www.xsede.org/), a nationwide network of distributed high-performance computing resources.  Snowball recruitment will be used to identify domain scientists, computational technologists, and supercomputer center administrators (across e-science projects, institutions, and disciplines) who have experience with adopting, developing, and using computational tools within the XSEDE ecosystem.  Interviews will seek to illuminate best practices and common pitfalls in the emergence of advanced computational tools and in the deployment of such tools by practicing CDS&E researchers.<br/><br/>Findings from this work will help NSF and other federal agencies to optimize existing and future CI investments.

Periodic surveys of HR managers find that HR has made little progress toward fulfilling a hoped-for strategic role in firms. This research team theorizes that this lack of progress may result from a fundamental conflict between competing institutional demands. They will explore how this conflict shapes actual HR practices and the roles that HR professionals play in organizations as well as the effects that such shaping may have. Empirically, the project relies on ethnographic observation, interviews, and an internal census of HR professionals in contrasting field settings: one high performer and one low performer in terms of workplace desirability. Selection of the companies to study also takes into account their industry's EEOC filing rate (claims filed per 1,000 employees), based on a unique data base created for this project. <br/><br/>In terms of broader impacts, the results should be applicable to numerous professions affected by tensions between their aims to enhance competitiveness and efforts to ensure compliance with regulation: for example, accountants as well as CEOs dealing with Sarbanes-Oxley or automotive design engineers making tradeoffs between legislated safety targets and fuel efficiency. Furthermore, the project will create a unique database of EEOC filing rates by industry. These data will be updated annually and made available to all interested researchers. Finally, to the extent that the project uncovers the internal processes organizations use to address discrimination and unfair treatment complaints, its findings will offer an informed point of view on how agencies such as the EEOC can more effectively ensure internal compliance and, thus, reduce the burden associated with claims processing and enforcement."

Research on the use by companies of aspirational peers has focused on the prevalence and average overall level of bias, and has attempted to explain bias in terms of organizational and CEO characteristics rather than in terms of the networked environment. However, public corporations are tied to one another in networks along various dimensions, including similarity in industry and size, board interlocks, the sharing of compensation consultants, and the network of asserted compensation peers used by companies in the setting of executive compensation. The proposed research tests the theory that pressures for legitimacy and rationalizations of practices of contested legitimacy occur through mechanisms of local comparison, which involve both information transfer and the mimicry and co-evolution of controversial practices. Using stochastic actor oriented network analytic methods, the proposed research will estimate the effects of social influence and social comparison on the evolution of compensation networks in the post-2006 period, when the network is newly visible both to researchers and to the corporations themselves as a consequence of the new SEC rules. These questions are addressed through the analysis of a unique database that contains information on compensation peers for the universe of companies that have reported this information since the new regulations came into effect.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this project is the new understanding it promises about the dynamics of compensation peer networks of publicly traded corporations and the illumination these dynamics offer on the diffusion and modification of controversial organizational practices. A longstanding literature on the diffusion of innovations and organizational practices treated the practices in question as relatively fixed and studied the rate and extent of diffusion through the population. More recently, scholars have focused on the fact that many organizational practices are controversial, and as a consequence they advance, evolve, and retreat in response to environmental pressure and the conflicting interests of organizational actors and stakeholders. This recent literature emphasizes characteristics of organizations (e.g., the ""fit"" of the practice with the organization and organizational actors along various dimensions) that potentially explain the adoption, adaptation, or relinquishment of controversial practices. In contrast, the impact of organizational networks on the spread and evolution of controversial practices is relatively unexplored. The proposed research contributes to the filling of this gap. In the process it may provide an explanation for how the overall upward compensation bias in executive compensation peer groups is maintained and whether it is likely to persist into the future.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The broader impacts of the proposed research include the training of undergraduate and graduate students and the potential value of the proposed research for public policy. The project will also allow the continued collection of longitudinal data on compensation peers on a scale that does not elsewhere exist. After the project is concluded, these data will be made available for other researchers and also accessible for a non-technical audience. Using Javascript and HTML5 the query results can be visualized as a network, and network descriptives will be presented in a table. Publishing the data through such an infrastructure allows the data to be used for education purposes, and it allows non-technical audiences to explore this rich data source. The algorithm used to identify and extract peers from corporate annual reports in the electronic archive of the SEC can easily be generalized to extract systematic and previously unavailable data items in a wide variety of contexts. Instructions will be provided to allow researchers to use the algorithm for such purposes."

This complexity often hides the locus of decision making, raising key problems of accountability for citizens and interest groups of all kinds. Public policy governance systems offer important opportunities to understand these dynamics and their consequences, because public policy by nature attempts to adjudicate among competing interests to produce some form of public good.  This project examines legislators' decisions to allocate public funds to private nonprofit organizations that provide social services in a large city.  As the proportion of publicly-supported welfare services privately provided has grown, nonprofit organizations increasingly mediate the relationship between local legislators and their constituencies. In turn, nonprofits have become increasingly dependent on government contracts, leaving the amount and quality of public services that citizens experience greatly affected by nonprofits? location and capacity to attract funding. <br/><br/>How legislators allocate discretionary public funds to nonprofits reveals two key dynamics of social welfare governance: patronage relationships between legislators, their constituencies, and local nonprofits; and political exchange relationships between legislators. Patronage involves delivering and claiming credit for public resources allocated to a legislator?s district. Presumably, the reward for successful patronage is re-election by one?s constituents.  Political exchange involves deals cut among legislators that lead to the allocation of public resources to a legislator?s district, and/or to specific votes on legislation. Focusing on the network structure produced by this governance system and its consequences for specific citizen constituencies, this project asks: (1) What is the structure of patronage relationships between municipal legislators and their district constituencies? And how does it relate to the re-election prospects of municipal legislators, the growth of nonprofit organizations, and citizens? needs? (2) What is the structure of political exchange relationships among municipal legislators? And what are legislators? individual and district characteristics that make them more likely to initiate and reciprocate exchange patterns? (3) How does the structure of political exchange relate to whether consequential legislative proposals are passed?<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This project contributes to three distinct literatures: (1) By studying sociological processes through a social network approach, it provides a contemporary picture of patronage patterns at the community level, assesses the mutual dependence of legislators and nonprofit organizations, and evaluates the distributive consequences for citizens? welfare. (2) Public administration scholars are concerned with the relative balance of managerial best practices and distributional equity in state administration. This is the first study that examines how patronage fits into a larger system of merit-based public service contracting. (3) This project also advances political science?s understanding of distributive politics by disentangling mechanisms of patronage and exchange at the local level.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: In conjunction with prior NSF-funded work, this project will allow comparison of 3 mechanisms of public resource allocation to nonprofit organizations: patronage, political exchange, and competition. Project results will be communicated via a written policy brief and presentations to audiences in government, the nonprofit sector, and the media. The dataset resulted from the project will offer an important resource to scholars, practitioners, and government officials. It also provides a model set of procedures for constructing datasets for other cities or states that have similar discretionary forms of public resource allocation."

As a result of this work-family conflict, a parent may experience low morale at work, stress, and depression, all of which have profound effects on their work engagement and productivity. Such tension between work and family may potentially impact the home environment as well, including negative effects on how adolescent children in the family think, feel, and behave. However, we know little about these effects, and also whether a negative home environment may have similarly negative effects on parents at work. Our project seeks to study work-family conflict and its effects on the home environment (and vice versa) using controlled laboratory methods, and methods that allow for the study of these factors in ""real-life"" outside of the laboratory. By understanding the ways in which work-family conflict and the home environment influence each other, we may gain a better understanding of how to improve functioning in both work and home domain, and thus increase parents' work engagement and productivity.     <br/><br/>Many employees in the U.S. experience high demands to fulfill obligations both at work and at home (Galinsky et al. 2009). The incompatibility of heightened pressure from both work and home is referred to as work-family conflict (Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985), high levels of which place employees at increased risk for a host of poor work and psychosocial outcomes (e.g., job dissatisfaction, turnover, depression; Allen, 2012). Moreover, to the extent that child care poses demands in the family domain (Bianchi & Milkie, 2010), the children of employees are important stakeholders in the work-family interface. Yet, the role of employees? children in absorbing the impact or being a source of work-family conflict has received scant attention. Such issues are particularly important to address in families with adolescents. Specifically, work-family conflict creates contexts in which parents have fewer resources or time to monitor their adolescents' whereabouts and activities, likely placing adolescents at high risk for poor psychosocial outcomes (Smetana, 2008). In fact, relative to younger children, adolescents are more likely to display problem behaviors (e.g., depression and substance abuse) that increase parent-adolescent conflict, which may affect parents' time and energy at work. Thus, we propose to address research questions within families who have adolescent children. Specifically, we propose two studies that test both directions of a mediation model informed by the spillover hypothesis of life stressors (Staines, 1980). Based on prior work indicating that parent-adolescent conflict evidences reciprocal relations with children's psychosocial adjustment (Burt et al., 2005), we propose that the reciprocal relations between work-family conflict and adolescent psychosocial maladjustment are mediated by parent-adolescent conflict. Further, our team members have training in not only diverse social science disciplines, but also diverse research settings. Accordingly, we propose two studies that test the model described previously in both field and laboratory settings, allowing each study's strengths to address the limitations of the other study. First, we will test both directions of the above-mentioned mediation model using daily diaries, completed by both parents and adolescents, conducted over a two-week period to measure work-family conflict, parent-adolescent conflict, parental work functioning, and adolescent psychosocial functioning. Second, we will test the same theoretical model using a laboratory design. Specifically, we will recruit family dyads with one full-time working parent and one adolescent for a laboratory study. We will randomly assign each full-time working parent and adolescent dyad to one of three levels of the independent variable: (a) task induction of parental work stress and a low-stress condition for the adolescent, (b) task induction of adolescent psychosocial stress and a low-stress condition for the parent, and (c) both parent and adolescent assigned to a low-stress condition. Next, we will administer a controlled task meant to reflect parent-adolescent conflict (i.e., mediator variable), and we will objectively assess parent and adolescent physiological flexibility (i.e., an index of emotional dysregulation) during this task. We then will administer performance-based tasks of parental work functioning and adolescent psychosocial functioning to test the impact of parent-adolescent conflict on these domains, as well as the cross-domain, indirect impacts of parental work stress and adolescent psychosocial stress. The proposed project promises to improve our basic understanding of the spillover between parents? work experiences and non-work family life."

Millions of dollars are spent in the public and private sectors to support research collaborations among scientists who possess the breadth and depth of expertise to address these complex problems. An increasingly prevalent approach to integrating diverse expertise is the use of interdisciplinary science teams. Although interdisciplinary scientific collaboration has many success stories, it is also true that in many cases these teams fail to successfully integrating the knowledge needed to address a problem.  The goal of knowledge integration among diverse scientists is often elusive due to the make-up of the teams, lack of understanding about best practices for managing collaborations, and team leaders who are scientific experts but have not been trained to lead diverse teams of professionals. The consequence can be a costly investment in scientific endeavors that do not reap the expected benefits. It is critical that interdisciplinary science teams have the capability to collaborate and integrate their knowledge.  A team's integrative capacity is a core competence necessary for these teams to perform successfully.  Integrative capacity is a capability that is sustained through an interactive system linking social, psychological, and cognitive processes and emergent states in the team that can provide them with the resources needed to succeed. This research investigates how the development of a team's integrative capacity and subsequent knowledge outcomes are impacted by: (1) boundary-spanning leadership behaviors and (2) communication structuring interventions. Exposure to these interventions can nurture team members' trans-disciplinary intellectual orientation, the enduring values, beliefs, skills, and behaviors that support collaboration with teammates who have diverse disciplinary backgrounds, which in turn fosters the development of integrative capacity.  <br/><br/>Broader Impact. Given the reliance of society on interdisciplinary science teams for advancement in key areas such as medicine, education, security, and technology, the development of theoretical and practical knowledge about how to build and maintain integrative capacity in these teams is imperative. This research directly supports the aims of the SciSIP program and the NSF by investigating the structures, processes, and interventions that facilitate the development of usable knowledge by interdisciplinary science teams. First, this study sheds light on how leader and communication interventions can enhance a team's integrative capacity and team members' trans-disciplinary intellectual orientation, both of which can support teams working across boundaries to generate new solutions to complex problems. Second, training material and digital metrics developed in this research can be leveraged to foster improved scientific collaboration in teams beyond those included in this study.

When a single issue or objective crosses multiple independent units, collective action and coordination problems can arise from fragmented authority. Local sustainability is a broad and complex issue and provides an ideal lens through which to study these organizational challenges. Despite the widespread adoption of sustainability goals by local governments, an administrative apparatus to coordinate their implementation is lacking or inconsistent in many communities. This research examines the impact that different administrative arrangements have on policy efforts and outcomes and assesses the institutional structures necessary to facilitate the success of local sustainability efforts. Functional coordination and collective action problems within a single government are similar to institutional collective action problems that arise from fragmented governmental authority within metropolitan areas. In both cases, the connectedness of services, objectives, and resource systems produces positive and negative externalities. Resolution of these dilemmas requires additional resources and expertise, as well as the development of administrative structures to integrate decision-making. This work intends to initiate a general theory of institutional collective action that encompasses administrative dilemmas within as well as between organizations. It proceeds in two stages: First, it will collect quantitative data on administrative institutions via surveys administered to local government officials. Second, eight cities will be selected for in-depth analysis based on characterizations developed from their survey responses. An analytic narratives approach and social network analysis will be applied to explore the mechanisms available for overcoming functional collective action dilemmas in local sustainability. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>Although functional coordination has long been a concern within public administration, these issues are not emphasized in contemporary policy theories. Little is known about how the design of administrative mechanisms influences organizational ability to integrate decisions and resolve functional collective action problems. Even less is known about how administrative mechanisms affect policy outputs and outcomes at the organizational level. Through an exploration of city sustainability policy, this research will initiate a theory of functional collective action that extends institutional collective action research beyond its current focus on horizontal and vertical fragmentation among independent governments. Findings will provide insight to address the common problem of ""fuzzy boundaries,"" whereby the lack of clear lines of responsibility for tackling complex policy issues necessitates more coordinated efforts. This research will systemically identify the strengths and weaknesses associated with different mechanisms for overcoming functional collective action and enable municipalities to make more informed choices and minimize administrative dilemmas within as well as between organizations. The results of this analysis are expected to be of applied value to local government practitioners. Additionally, the empirical survey data collected from this research will contribute to the broader study of urban governance and policy in the US and enable researchers to better examine sustainability and local government administration questions."

All together, the results have the potential to advance our understanding of team collaboration, team formation, communication networks and team performance.<br/><br/>The research examines the effects of communication networks on transactive memory system development and team performance. A transactive memory system (TMS) is a collective system for encoding, storing and retrieving information. Teams with well-developed TMSs have been found to perform better across a variety of tasks compared to teams lacking TMSs.  Known as systems of ""who knows what,"" a TMS emerges through communications and interactions among team members as they learn and rely on each other's skills and knowledge.  Although a TMS hinges on communication and interaction, very little research has been conducted on how communication networks affect a group's TMS. Communication networks constrain or enable communication within a team and thus potentially alter the development of TMS. Our research investigates the characteristics of communication networks that enhance the development of TMS in a series of studies incorporating complementary laboratory and archival methods. First, we manipulate the communication networks that exist within teams in an experiment to examine the effects of network characteristics on the team's TMS and performance. We investigate two dimensions of team performance: the number of errors and creativity. Second, because in many contexts individuals choose their own networks and/or their positions within the network, we compare the effects of networks and position assignments that are imposed by the experimenter to those that are chosen by participants.  This enables us to determine if effects observed are due to the communication network itself or due to participants' enactment of the network. By manipulating the networks and using random assignment to networks and to positions within the networks, we are able to make causal statements about the effects of network characteristics on TMS development and team performance.  Third, using data from our experiments, we will develop and refine a new unobtrusive, behavioral measure of TMS.  This measure will be applied to data from real teams who use online networks for large-scale technology-mediated projects. Following the validation of this new TMS measure, we will examine how it relates to performance for large online teams."

As organizations attempt to simultaneously become leaner and more flexible, this creates a need to create teams that cross divisional boundaries in a context where there are fewer people to buffer communications across functions. The academic literature, as well as corporate experience indicates that direct face-to-face inputs from people different than ourselves is faster, cheaper and of higher knowledge quality than classic technology transfer. Thus, multiteam situations are a natural response to the competitive pressures faced by many organizations. Still, although multiteam systems have the potential to solve many problems related to both routine operations and innovations solutions, they also create unique issues and conditions that require special attention to boundary spanning relationships both within and between highly specialized teams. The large number of members within a typical multiteam system, along with the specialized nature of their knowledge base, makes it impossible for every member to fruitfully talk to each and every other member, thus dictating a formal network of boundary spanners within the multiteam system. However, the large size and specialization associated with multiteam systems also creates more potential for Simmelian ties the emergence of informal boundary spanners outside the formal network. These additional informal ties can either reinforce are undermine the formal structure and the research proposed here will develop new theory and provide new data that seeks to improve our understanding of the interplay of formal and informal networks on processes and performance in multiteam systems.<br/><br/>This project will study these phenomena at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) at Michigan State University, a facility that is a state of the art complex for studying high particle physics and is at the forefront of the competitive world of scientific discovery and knowledge expansion. In addition, the composition of its workforce, which is a multicultural representation of top researchers from all over the world, serves as vivid manifestation of the challenges faced by modern multinational organizations trying to leverage their human knowledge capital. The FRIB is structured as a set of multiteam systems linked by boundary spanners and the needs for inter-team knowledge sharing trigger both a planned formal ties as well as ad hoc informal ties. Using in-depth interviews, surveys, and network analysis protocols, this project examines the positive and negative aspects of informal third-party ties and how these are influenced by individual characteristics, dyadic relational characteristics and team attributes related to structure and leadership."

Current interest in how firms and products are categorized focuses primarily on the detrimental consequences of miscategorization for firm performance. By comparison, our understanding of which product and firm level attributes define membership in a category is less well developed. Probing these attributes is vital to determining the relative comparability of products and firms, as well as the competitive boundaries of markets. We consider these issues in the food and beverage industry, which is an ideal setting to explore questions about product categories, competition and firm performance. Given the variety of product types and variants within type, as well as the spatial proximity of firms, comparability through categorization shapes not only how consumers compare and choose among different options but also how firms compete and with whom, as well as how and where new firms are established. A focus on the food and beverage industry also has the benefits for enhancing understanding of the dynamics associated with how female and minority participation may affect firm competitiveness, because the industry includes more female and minority managers than any other industry. <br/><br/>Identifying the boundaries of competition and their effects in imperfectly competitive markets has challenged both theorists and empiricists. Imperfectly competitive markets are those in which producers can differentiate themselves from one another along one or more dimensions of products and/or services. The notion of differentiation itself, however, is non-trivial and dependent upon complex sets of similarity inferences among buyers, firms, suppliers, and third parties such as media critics, analysts, and regulators. Firms and products can be described along a large number of attributes, and can be viewed as more or less similar depending on the attributes used for comparison, how these are defined, when they are compared, and by whom. This complex dimensionality is at the root of many theoretical and practical questions regarding how a market is demarcated, what firms are competing in the same market, the competitive structure of a market, the effect of this structure on firm outcomes, and even the meaning of imperfect competition and competitive advantage. We posit that imperfectly competitive markets are cognitively embedded across levels of analysis. This embeddedness raises important questions about the consistency and coherence of market interpretations across levels, and also requires the use of different sorts of data to fully understand competitive structures and their effects. We propose to address this gap in the literature on markets by using multi-level data on competition among firms in food and beverage industry, and by using these data to account for entrepreneurial success or failure in this industry. Our data consists of the archival data (e.g., demographic composition of neighborhoods, the revenues of firms, third-party reviews) and primary data (e.g., interview and survey data from owners). We will first map the five-year competitive structure of the industry, and then use this structure to predict the hazard of failure of firms starting the following year."

However, the discussion on the role played by the intellectual capital of the workforce employed by entrepreneurial firms has been limited. Is it the case that the entrepreneurs that succeed are different in their stock of intellectual capital and these differences are manifested and rewarded by the market very early on, or is it that their early advantages and location choices enable them to navigate market imperfections and shocks that hinder less lucky establishments? In this project, we study how the skill-level of entrepreneurial firms in the United States has changed over the past decade particularly in response to competitive shocks. The proposed project can inform what types of entrepreneurs succeed, the specific role played by founders' human capital, and how shocks such as increased competition and technological changes affect entrepreneurial firm outcomes. <br/><br/>To understand the drivers of the stock of intellectual capital in entrepreneurial firms, we will assemble a longitudinal database on the skill profiles of entrepreneurial firms. The data will be sourced from establishment level micro-data from a panel of large-scale surveys conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the skills of employees of start-ups and incumbent firms in over 800 occupations in U.S. over 2005-2013. Using over 10 million establishment-occupation level observations, we will address three primary research questions. First, we will identify the change in the composition of skills of entrants over this period, and factors that are associated with these changes. Second, we will identify environmental shocks and their effects on the intellectual capital and competitiveness of entrepreneurial firms. Finally, we will examine the long-term consequences of founding intellectual capital on firms' subsequent intellectual capital and other outcomes."

RTOs are highly complex socio-technical organizations that are challenged to facilitate fundamental transformations in how electricity is produced and delivered, driven by individual state mandates requiring increased use of renewable fuel sources (primarily from variable sources such as wind and solar energy). RTOs must adapt to these mandates through policy innovation, a difficult organizational problem since decision-making by RTOs happens within a complex negotiation framework involving a large number of voluntary external stakeholders (e.g., electricity generating companies, regulators, consumer and environmental advocates). The focus of this comparative analysis among three RTOs (serving the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and California) is to understand how, why, and when these networks of conflicting stakeholders can lead to innovation. The approach blends direct observation of policy-formation processes with semi-structured interviews in an empirical investigation of the configuration of stakeholder networks within RTOs and the communication strategies employed by RTO stakeholders within the policy process.<br/><br/>RTOs play a critical role in the transition to more sustainable energy systems, making decisions that are pivotal to environmental quality, economic growth and security, and social well-being. The focus of this research, which is designed to understand processes of communication in complex dynamic organizations, will provide direct insights that can contribute to the sustainable transformation of similar organizations and infrastructures critical to social well-being. This program of engaged scholarship includes the gathering of primary data on stakeholder perceptions of policy-formation processes within RTOs, as well as meetings and workshops held jointly with university researchers, industry practitioners, and regulators."

This project examines four important questions about social movements using<br/>combined and augmented data from two prior NSF-funded projects, the Dynamics of Collective<br/>Action project and the Political Organizations in the News project.<br/><br/>First, the project will compare social movement dynamics using data on protest events versus data on social movement organizations (SMOs) with the innovative dataset described above. Second, the project investigates how disruptive tactics affect news media coverage of social movements and social movement organizations by using data on protest events. Given the continued importance of the news media, better understanding the dynamics that drive media attention is an important question for social movement scholars. Third, the project assesses the extent to which protest and the news coverage of SMOs may influence public opinion trends over time. Specifically, we expect that specific types of movement events shape how favorably the movement is perceived, that this shifts over the lifespan of the movement and depends on political responses to the movement. Finally, our project will examine a key methodological issue of interest to researchers: Selection bias suggests that the news media cover only a portion of social life and do so in selective and structured manners. Our project will use data on protest events and SMOs to pinpoint the differences between selective reporting on protest events versus the selective reporting on SMOs. Quantitative analyses will rely on negative binomial models, ARMA models, multinomial logistic regressions, as well as time series analysis.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Understanding the dynamics that shape political participation in a democratic context is an issue of broad interest to the general public and policy makers alike. Similarly, furthering our understanding of media coverage and public opinion of political activism is important to a broad set of stakeholders.  Findings from this study may be of interest to policy analysts involved in monitoring domestic and international events and trends.  Broader impacts also include the creation of publically available dataset on domestic political activism since 1960 at a scale hitherto unknown.  In addition, methodological advances produced in the process of creating the data set, as well as those derived from analysis will be made available to the public. The project will also offer substantial research training to undergraduate and graduate students."

Through the formation of network clusters focused around four common themes and a series of workshops and conferences, this research coordination network will help bridge the boundary or disconnect between these multiple ""invisible colleges"" and make researchers more aware of theoretical arguments and research findings developing outside of their school.  The research coordination network would encourage boundary-spanning interactions that are likely to result in novel research projects and initiatives that will enable development of a more complete view of the interplay between institutional factors such as intellectual property rights and individual factors such as motivations and incentives that affect the creation of scientific knowledge, its diffusion and potential commercialization and use.   <br/><br/>Understanding the creation and transfer of knowledge is of great importance both to the scientific community and to nurturing a national innovation ecosystem that will enhance national competitiveness and security. Scholarly research is currently fragmented so could benefit greatly from integration and an integrated view can guide both national policy and organizational practice and the ability to create and transfer knowledge is a distinct source of competitive advantage.  Indeed, as the half-life of products and even entire product categories has decreased, the ability to create and transfer knowledge has become even more important because both factors shape a firm's ability to improve existing products and work routines and to develop new products and work routines. Research coordinated by the network would improve our ability to manage the production and distribution of knowledge within and between organizations.  Scientists and women in particular, must overcome a significant number of barriers as they attempt to commercialize their ideas.  Research that combines organizational and individual factors could shed light on how best to overcome those barriers in particular and to knowledge creation and transfer in general. New projects encouraged by the network could prove particularly valuable for life scientists and the large number of people who benefit from their ideas and innovations."

Three questions are analyzed 1) Why do some high technology industries have higher rates of scientist mobility and entrepreneurship than others? 2) What are the innovation diffusion patterns across high technology industries due to mobility and entrepreneurial entry of scientific personnel? 3) How do industry characteristics interact with firm and individual attributes to impact employment growth of new ventures created by industrial scientists? <br/><br/>The project centers on the role of complementary assets and posits that inter-industry differences in their importance play a critical role in explaining industry heterogeneity in the rates and outcomes of industrial scientist mobility and entrepreneurship decisions and thus serve as the theoretical underpinnings for all three research questions. A particular focus is on inter-industry differences in the importance and transportability of complementary non-human assets, how they shape the career decisions of individual scientists, and how they affect both the levels of scientist mobility and entrepreneurship within industries and the direction of scientist mobility and entrepreneurship that occurs across industry boundaries. The empirical analysis of the data focuses on scientists working in high-tech industry settings tracks scientists? entrepreneurship and mobility within and between these high-tech sectors.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: In contrast to most of the prior literature that studied the antecedents and consequences of the career choices of scientists at the firm level and within a single industry context, this research examines the questions by focusing on individual level decisions in a broad cross-industry setting. This thus examines multiple important gaps that are of interest to both policy makers and academics. In particular, by building the micro-foundations of the knowledge diffusion process at the individual scientist unit of analysis, it helps to build a systematic understanding of inter-industry differences in industrial scientist mobility and entrepreneurship in high tech industries. Understanding industry heterogeneity in the antecedents and consequences of the career choices of industrial scientists is particularly important in the context of understanding and promoting industry renewal as scientists are likely to play a key role in the creation and commercialization of new technologies which can have important growth effects at the firm-, industry-, and regional-level.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The study informs science and innovation policy makers about what industry conditions are most conducive to employment growth via entrepreneurship by scientific personnel. In addition, it examines the results of incentivizing a potentially crucial but heretofore under-examined source of high tech entrepreneurship: scientists employed outside of the focal industry. The results may also inform scientists' career decisions about industry-level factors that may facilitate or create impediments to successful start-up entry and subsequent growth."

On the one hand, sociological research convincingly argues for the ""dominance of teams in the production of knowledge,"" particularly in the production of ""high-impact"" knowledge. On the other hand, research shows that many science teams, particularly the ones most prized for their diverse and distributed ""dream teams"" are especially prone to underachieving when it comes to publications, patents, and commercialization. This program of research investigates a large number of scientific collectives, from their initial formation to their maturity, in order to uncover the dynamic interplay between structure (i.e., how the collective is designed) and process (i.e., leadership and member interactions). Although collaboration across disciplines and units has been frequently recognized as one of the key obstacles to innovation, research is needed to determine how system design affects the multi-level processes that facilitate collaboration within and across teams and units. This research integrates psychological, organizational, and network science perspectives in a multilevel system model to detail the impact of goals, leadership, and system design on key drivers of collaboration within and across teams in innovation systems. Four empirical studies are being conducted over the course of two years in order to evaluate the impact of variations in the architecture of scientific innovation systems on resulting innovation. This research investigates scientific collectives comprised of students working across two universities, three disciplines, and two countries who must work collaboratively to solve interdisciplinary challenges in environmental sustainability.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts.

Over the last decade, science policy has increasingly focused on the benefits of knowledge sharing, openness, and collaboration, a policy theme that has motivated a number of large recent investments by the NSF and other funding agencies in cyberinfrastructure development and deployment. The success of these investments however depends on attention to field-specific practices and cultures that may influence or even block adoption of cyberinfrastructure. This exploratory project sets out to advance a new interdisciplinary methodology that integrates ethnographic field studies with the analysis of large-scale publication networks to strengthen the empirical basis for understanding field differences in scientific collaboration.  <br/><br/>Methodologically, this project offers an innovative integration of quantitative network analysis of large publication networks with qualitative ethnographic field studies. Theoretically and substantively, it illustrates on the multi-level temporal dynamics that shape, and sometimes frustrate, efforts at scientific collaboration and innovation. The methodology developed in this project supports field-level comparisons of scientific communities and fills a critical gap in the research capabilities of scientometrics, innovation studies, and science policy, which are too often split between macro-scale (countries, disciplines, journals) or micro-scale (individuals, specific research localities) analyses, neglecting meso-scale dynamics that are formative to the shape and outcome of scientific knowledge production within and across fields.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project investigates the addition of a temporal dimension to a network ethnographic approach to study and compare temporal dimensions of scientific collaboration across research fields. The test cases are provided by two research fields (in ecology and at the boundary between physics and chemistry) that exhibit significant variation in the temporal rhythms that underlie the structure of short- and long-term collaborations within a research group and between this group and its collaborators.  Adding temporality to the analysis increases the resolution of collective structures in publication networks to support the strategic sampling of ethnographic field sites; enables the study of the emergence and evolution of collaborative structures at the team, sub-community, and field level and the detection of field-specific historical trends; and supports the search for field differences in the timing and rhythms of collaborative activities. This EAGER projects serves to explore and test the suitability of a network-analytic approach to capture scientific collaboration dynamics at various scales before deploying it in larger-scale empirical studies.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Through strengthening the empirical base to inform science and innovation policy and to guide investment decisions, this exploratory project develops a methodological approach with a wide re-use potential for the comparative study of collaboration dynamics in scientific communities. Understanding the field-specific dynamics, tensions, and challenges of collaboration practices and their evolution over time is critical when the potential benefit and impact of policy and socio-technical interventions (such as cyberinfrastructure, data sharing mandates, and new incentive schemes), and, by improving metrics to quantify the impacts of these investments, complements existing investments and informs future investments in these specific areas.<br/>"

Firms must choose among fast and slow product update cycles, simultaneous vs sequential experimentation and must align innovation and marketing.  These problems vary with the firm's existing capabilities, resources and technology, and also with demanders' needs and with the available institutions to reach out to new adopters.  The explosion in mobile app entrepreneurship is an unprecedented opportunity to identify failures and successful paths to innovation in a large-scale empirical setting.  Understanding the alignment of firm decisions to environment is an important frontier in entrepreneurial studies, and our research will create new and large datasets to examine the sources of entrepreneurial success in product innovation and marketing.  <br/><br/>This project employs a multi-method approach.  Preliminary case interviews for this research and inferences from the innovation and entrepreneurship literature suggest specific ways in which innovation strategies are linked to the extent to which a new market inherits capabilities, resources, technology, demand preferences and expectations from related markets. Further case interviews and a follow-up survey of developers to collect data on organizational structure, process, and culture will permit refinement of the linkages between entrepreneurial innovation strategies, market characteristics, and organizations.  This project will collect and analyze the ""big data"" currently available for entrepreneurship in the mobile applications ecosystem to understand how different experimentation strategies and organizational structures that lead to successful innovation link to variations in market characteristics. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The market characteristics, innovation strategies, and organizational choices studied in this project are not specific to the mobile app ecosystem. The findings from this project generalize to inform our understanding of how successful entrepreneurial innovation strategies and organizational choices vary with market characteristics overall. Identifying these specific market contingencies reveals the optimal policy, investment and organizational underpinnings of effective innovation. Public release of the data will be a critical public good for other research on platform competition, entrepreneurial organizations, resource acquisition, and innovation. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: Entrepreneurial innovation is a critical national issue that is central to economic growth and national competitiveness. The platform structure characterizes nearly all information and communications technologies sectors, so study of this setting benefits policies supporting applications entrepreneurship in many STEM-related industries. These findings may yield more general suggestions about how policies to promote economic growth through successful entrepreneurial innovation in all new industries (whether founded on platforms or not) should differ by market characteristics. The case studies will benefit teachers and partnerships between academics and industry, and the data will immediately provide research opportunities for scholars at the undergraduate level and above."

Scientific communities develop with a wide variety of talents and skills, harnessing the resources of multiple institutions, and tackling larger, more multifaceted problems.  The virtual research environment (a key type of cyberinfrastructure combining technologies for conducting research, analyzing data, coordinating projects, and enabling collaboration) has been shown to make significant contributions to the success of distributed science.  However, there are few systematic studies of the process by which these environments develop both through intentional design decisions negotiated among a diverse and changing set of stakeholders over an extended period of time and through unplanned events and contingencies.  <br/><br/>This project will advance and refine a theoretical framework for understanding the processes by which virtual research environments are developed and how these processes contribute to their effectiveness.  The framework proposes that virtual research environments are constructed through interactions among five critical activity tracks, specifically: (a) technological design and implementation, (b) scientific work, (c) the community of virtual research environment users, developers, funders and other stakeholders, (d) managerial and organizational system, and (e) critical events. The project will conduct in-depth longitudinal analyses of the sequences of events involved in the development of virtual research environments along the five tracks and trace inter-track influences.  It will assess the fit of various developmental models to identify factors that account for the development of the virtual research environments and the co-evolution of the tracks.  Finally, it will relate various features of the developmental process to effectiveness of virtual research environments in terms of productivity, collaboration, community development, and successful implementation and use of virtual research environment features.  <br/><br/>Results of this research will yield insights into how virtual research environments develop and change over time. The multidimensional model can be used to understand the conclusions drawn by previous case studies and to enable a more sophisticated analysis of cyberinfrastructure evolution that can identify key drivers and effectiveness.  The results also promise insights into other kinds of virtual organizations with multiple, complex sets of stakeholders. The project will advance process theory and research by providing a more complete specification of the types of relationships among process tracks and articulation of developmental models based on these relationships.  <br/><br/>Virtual research environments have great potential to advance scientific inquiry.  Understanding how they develop and how their effectiveness is related to their development over time would enable designers to improve the development process.  Knowledge of the various processes that promote or derail design, implementation, and use would increase the effectiveness of developers and managers of virtual research environments, and assure the best returns for public and private investments."

An explosion of research in this area over the last 30 years has produced an understanding of how networks operate in equilibrium conditions based on dyadic features like balance, homophily, and exchange. Yet we still do not understand the effects of individual agency and contextual factors like organizational activity.  The purpose of this project is to develop and test a theory of network structuring and development based on the activities of human agents influencing one another within group contexts.  This project makes four contributions: (1) modeling network nodes as agents with their own motives and networking tendencies, (2) describing the influence of focused activities on network development, (3) accounting for the influence of organizational structures and work units on network development, and (4) explaining network dynamics as the product of a loop of structure and behavior which influences one another over time.  Understanding these phenomena will enable better design of a wide range of organizations, as well as better prediction and mitigation of organizational failure.<br/><br/>The theoretical context of this work is Network Reticulation Theory (NRT).  This theory draws-together elements of structuration theory and activity focus theory to explain how perceived network relationships are activated by triggers in an organizational system, for example how a deadline in a software engineering firm activates certain elements of an organizational network to produce a hackathon, potentially strengthening the constituent network relationships in the process.  We study this process using a unique dataset comprising ubiquitous observation of a software engineering shop, from which data about perceived relationships, observed communication, task activities, and member perceptions are recorded for 79 employees over a period of three years.  To evaluate the theory, we employ three complimentary methods: (1) A direct test on the empirical data using statistical relational event modeling; (2) a multi-agent social-network simulation that faithfully models NRT by capturing activation, reticulation, and enactment processes; and (3) a cognitive multi-agent social-network simulation that adds architecture for decision making at the network nodes.  The project also utilizes a novel method for identifying network connections from audio recordings that offers a useful supplement to sociometric badges."

RTOs are highly complex socio-technical organizations that are challenged to facilitate fundamental transformations in how electricity is produced and delivered, driven by individual state mandates requiring increased use of renewable fuel sources (primarily from variable sources such as wind and solar energy). RTOs must adapt to these mandates through policy innovation, a difficult organizational problem since decision-making by RTOs happens within a complex negotiation framework involving a large number of voluntary external stakeholders (e.g., electricity generating companies, regulators, consumer and environmental advocates). The focus of this comparative analysis among three RTOs (serving the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and California) is to understand how, why, and when these networks of conflicting stakeholders can lead to innovation. The approach blends direct observation of policy-formation processes with semi-structured interviews in an empirical investigation of the configuration of stakeholder networks within RTOs and the communication strategies employed by RTO stakeholders within the policy process.<br/><br/>RTOs play a critical role in the transition to more sustainable energy systems, making decisions that are pivotal to environmental quality, economic growth and security, and social well-being. The focus of this research, which is designed to understand processes of communication in complex dynamic organizations, will provide direct insights that can contribute to the sustainable transformation of similar organizations and infrastructures critical to social well-being. Our program of engaged scholarship includes the gathering of primary data on stakeholder perceptions of policy-formation processes within RTOs, as well as meetings and workshops held jointly with university researchers, industry practitioners, and regulators."

Open innovation virtual organizations are formed to respond to a ""challenge call"" describing the need, providing specifications for desired solutions and setting a deadline for submissions.  Usually, this challenge call is delivered on a public forum with an invitation to those with expertise to share their solutions and an incentive for the best solution.   In addition, a cyberinfrastructure is established to support the development and delivery of solutions.  Solution proposers often participate in an online discussion forum where a social infrastructure is established with norms governing forum behavior.   At the end of the challenge, an award is announced to the best solution provider.<br/><br/>The incentives provided in most challenges inhibit knowledge sharing among contributors and collaboration is rare. Consequently, there is limited potential to involve diverse and unexpected innovation sources in solution development.  This project will develop a sociotechnical cyber infrastructure that manages the tensions inherent in open innovation virtual organizations to encourage collaboration among open innovation participants while mobilizing the energy and focus created by the competition of the open innovation challenge.  Through a series of open innovation natural experiments we will compare various interventions aimed at informing participants about collaborative ways to contribute and identify effective techniques.<br/><br/>Challenge calls can be an effective innovation technique applying science and engineering to important societal issues.  These new platforms are being used to find solutions for such diverse problems as developing an economical low energy use lightbulb, focused drug discovery, and reducing barriers facing returning veterans in higher education.  However, the methods currently used in challenges discourage the kind of collaboration that would be needed to leverage diverse ideas and generate greater innovation.

The dual needs of innovation and adaptability make teams the focus for skill development, knowledge sharing, and action. Moreover, the push toward collaboration and teamwork is global, as critical expertise is sought wherever it is located. Aided by technology, virtual teaming is ubiquitous. This has increased the diversity of team members and the heterogeneity of their cultural and ethnic backgrounds. This places primary emphasis on melding diversity and minimizing the potential for fragmentation, subgroup formation, and faultlines that fracture teams. Modern work teams are increasingly global, multicultural, and virtual. Given the increasing prominence of multicultural teams, one would expect that there would be a strong scientific foundation and conferences devoted to this topic, but that is not the case. There are literatures on culture and diversity, but they are not team centric. There are well-developed literatures on composing, training and developing, leading, and managing teams, but a focus on multicultural issues and their implications for team effectiveness theory and research is diffuse. This represents a significant gap in the literature. The purpose of the conference is to surface key conceptual gaps, synthesize differing perspectives, and advance an agenda for theory development and research to enhance multicultural team effectiveness. Multicultural team effectiveness encompasses important substantive topics of culture, diversity, and team effectiveness. Integrating these topics advances broader scientific and societal concerns as well. Recent research shows that science and engineering are increasingly collaborative and cross-disciplinary, and that collaborative science has more impact. Collaborative science entails multicultural teams. Advancing knowledge of how to ensure the success of multicultural teams will also advance diversity in science and technology.<br/><br/>Technical Description <br/><br/>There is a clear need to develop a more integrated understanding of the effects of culture and diversity across the spectrum of topics relevant to forming, developing, and leading effective teams. The fragmented literature necessitates theoretical integration, new research to close knowledge gaps, and the development of innovative applications to aid teamwork in multicultural contexts. The conference is designed to advance this integration by (a) targeting key experts across core topic areas (i.e., culture, diversity, team training, team leadership, and team effectiveness); (b) having them share their knowledge and insights on new developments across core topics; and (c) engaging them and diverse conference participants in interactive, focused discussion sessions to integrate ideas, identify gaps, and propose promising directions for synthesis, theory development, and new research. This approach will help to integrate this fragmented literature and to organize a coherent framework for conceptual progress, research advancement, and practical applications to improve multicultural team effectiveness. In addition, products from the conference will be publically available. Presentation materials and consented videos of presentations will be available for downloading from the Consortium for Multicultural Psychology Research (CMPR) website at the Department of Psychology, Michigan State University."

This large-scale database will contain information on products and services directly offered by public and private firms to their customers over the last 20 years, as well as links to the US Patent and Trademark Office's patent data for the last 20 years. The resulting database and analysis tool will enable researchers to answer many questions, including: How do industries, competition in industries and their products change over time? What are the dynamics of product introduction rates for private and public firms and how did private firms and their array of product offerings change during the recent financial crisis? What products are introduced by public and private firms following increases in patenting activity within an industry? Do the patenting firms introduce the new products or do non-patenting firms? Which government policy changes were most effective in stimulating the growth of entrepreneurial firms, and in what kind of markets did these policies work best? What local product market conditions are most conducive to successful entry by entrepreneurial firms and how do waves of innovation impact product market competition? What economic forces trigger firms to cross the boundary between public and private status? In addition to impacting academics that study innovation and how industries change over time, business decision makers, consumers, and regulators will benefit from the new industry designations. Businesses can use the database and web based tool to assess existing market structure around new products. This will facilitate more informed decisions about where and when to commit scarce resources to enter new markets. By examining the nature of existing competition and market structure by both public and private firms, large and small, entrepreneurs can also better assess the likely success of their new ventures. Regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) can also benefit from refined knowledge of industry structure and product market boundaries. <br/><br/>This project will produce a highly scalable approach for mining historical Web data to create comprehensive product-based databases and tools to query and analyze this data. This integrated database will be built using firm web pages from the Internet Archive Wayback Machine project.  Using the text from these web pages, the resulting database will classify firms as competitors, which will be used to build new industry definitions. These new industry definitions will be based directly on the product and service descriptions firms use to interface with customers. The project will produce a publicly available web-based analytical tool based on ""Elasticsearch"" (www.elasticsearch.com). This tool will allow users to query the database of public and private firms, their competitors, and the products they offer. Using this tool, a user will be able to input a company, or list of companies, and the tool will provide that company's product descriptions and a list of its competitors that produce similar products, along with the corresponding similarity scores, indicating the strength of competitive links.

Territory management in organizations is a natural behavior stemming from evolutionary pressures to reinforce or expand one's own group's territory within an environment, but can have both beneficial and harmful outcomes in modern day organizations. While beneficial outcomes of territory management in organizations can include decision efficacy, team cohesion, and clear expectations about work, harmful outcomes include lost market share, missed opportunities, gridlock, and a cycle of relational deterioration among groups. Little is currently understood about what territory management looks like in organizations, what the conditions are that lead to harmful versus beneficial consequences, and how territory management might be reinforced in organizations.  The proposed research uses a mixed method approach to study this phenomenon in organizations. Two studies will be conducted. The first involves a qualitative study into the behaviors and forms through which territory management manifests in organizations, and possible conditions that lead to harmful versus beneficial effects. The second study will involve a dynamic computation modeling study to test factors that may reinforce cycles of territory management in organizations. Findings will be used to help managers identify if a cycle of territory management among their groups is occurring and possible leverage points they may have to break the loop of territory management among their groups if necessary. Further, the proposed research will help future researchers more advantageously target their resources in conducting research on cross-group conflict over organizational territories. <br/><br/>Territory management in organizations is a natural behavior stemming from evolutionary pressures to reinforce or expand one's own group's territory within an environment, but can have both beneficial and harmful outcomes in modern day organizations. The current project seeks to better understand this phenomenon in organizations using a mixed method approach by (1) collecting empirical data to articulate the behaviors and forms in which territory management between groups manifest, and to begin linking these behaviors and forms to antecedents and consequences; (2) formally modeling key theoretical features relevant to territory management among groups in organizations through a computational model informed by literature and data from the empirical study; and (3) begin testing propositions and emergent predictions within the extended theoretical space that only computational modeling allows (e.g., enabling the exploration of emergent outcomes arising from individual groups interacting and reacting to one another and their environment over time). This project will help develop and refine a conceptual model of territory management and offer a new lens through which to understand cross-group interactions.  A territory management lens has the potential to synthesize aspects of intergroup conflict, such as group identity, finite resources, uncertainty and change, legitimacy, and control and autonomy, into a more parsimonious model.  The proposed computational modeling approach will help to test which variables are fundamental in a system view of territory management, while the proposed empirical study may help begin to untangle what types of territory management behaviors may be beneficial or harmful to groups (and their organizations)."

Over the 20th century, NGOs became instrumental in providing social services, advocating for marginalized communities, and working as partners in state governance. Now, however, these organizations are increasingly confronted with political repression and decreased access to necessary resources that sustain their work. How are these new challenges are transforming NGOs: their strategies, missions, and their overall numbers? Findings from this investigation offer important insights into how NGOs are navigating this moment and how external supporters can ensure their instrumental work continues.<br/><br/>This project investigates how different political, economic, cultural, and ecological threats influence the missions and strategies of NGOs, along with their overall scale, using different quantitative and causal methods. To do so, this study develops two types of original data. The first builds on a previously assembled dataset of roughly 10,000 minority-serving NGOs from 172 countries between 1980-2022. This dataset tracks the founding rates and mission statements of each NGO over time.  The second component is an original survey administered to each NGO. This survey asks organizational leaders how strategies have fluctuated amidst different types of potential threats. Together, these datasets have the ability to unlock a variety of insights into the cultures, needs, strategies, and operations of NGOs, even beyond the current proposal. This research not only advance theoretical understandings of how organizations operate during a period of unprecedented threat but contributes a new resource of minority-serving organizations accessible to those in need.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, this focus overlooks the fact that working in organizations is a social experience that can be rewarding and inspiring, or even frustrating and exhausting, and organizational members experience of such work climates can hinder or override rational processes. These product-focused (e.g., mechanical engineering) and person-focused (e.g., organizational psychology) approaches to organizational effectiveness tend to be studied independently, to the detriment of complete understanding productive and innovative workplaces. Each discipline has their own theoretical assumptions and research paradigms, e.g., engineering scholars focus on computational models and algorithms, and organizational psychologists obtain subjective reports and observational data. Theoretical advances require awareness and integration across these disciplines.  Methodological advances have also emerged that may permit better integration of these approaches, such as technology that records dynamic audio or video of team interactions and mapped in real time to the team processes and outcomes.  Although scholars are becoming more aware that both the people-oriented and product-oriented approaches matter to organizational effectiveness, this does not mean that they understand how these should be integrated.  Moving forward in the science of organizations requires cross-disciplinary discussions from scholars across academic silos.  As such, this workshop seeks to foster communication between leaders in the fields of engineering design, business, and organizational psychology, in order to advance the science of organizations through novel interactions between these disciplines.  <br/><br/>An interdisciplinary two-day workshop will be held at Penn State University in University Park, PA.  The goal is to advance the science of organizations - specifically modeling organizational productivity and innovation - through communication about advances in theory and research.  We will use three strategies to obtain this goal.  First, there will be papers and presentations shared from leaders in several disciplines who share a common interest in modeling the productivity and innovation of organizations and openness to multidisciplinary perspectives.  These leaders in the field include named professors and department chairs, editors of top journals, and active scholars with grant funding, from organizational psychology, business, computer science, and engineering.  Second, scholars will discuss new methodological advances for studying how organizational members work together toward shared goals, including ways to integrate the rational decision making models and the subjective multilevel and dynamic human experience.  Finally, there will be informal breakout sessions to encourage cross-disciplinary conversations about the presentations, and permit collaborative opportunities to emerge.  Junior scholars and graduate students with related interests will be invited to attend to advance the next wave of organizational scholarship.  This workshop will provide unique opportunities to build novel theories and research approaches that more truly and comprehensively capture the complexity of productive and innovative processes in today's workplace."

The partnerships can take many forms including philanthropy, cause marketing, brand certification, and collective impact arrangements. Through communication, the contours of the partnership are made known to different stakeholder groups thereby influencing attitudes, intention to purchase, intention to donate, and intention to engage in activism. The research examines both activists and consumers' reactions to a variety of messages about corporate-NGO partnerships by using a series of three on-line experiments to map both consumers and activists' mental models of corporations and NGOs. This project fulfills three important objectives: (1) to further our understanding of the impact of communicated NGO-corporate partnerships on consumers and activists' attitudes, intention to purchase, intention to donate, and intention to engage in activism, (2) to understand the ways that such messages might overcome initially incongruent pairings through the inclusion of or exclusion of certain message characteristics, and (3) to understand how the different forms of NGO-corporate partnership may moderate these relationships.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this project is three-fold. First, it contributes to the study of semantic networks by investigating factors that shape how individuals' mental models evolve to incorporate new information. Second, this project extends previous marketing research on brand pairings to include a broader spectrum of social issues, stakeholders beyond consumers (i.e., activists), and multiple types of NGO-corporate partnerships. Third, it contributes to a broad-based understanding of the network of NGO-corporate partnerships through its testing of theoretically driven propositions.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This research offers three broader impacts for educational, policy and industry sectors. First, the project advances social science and computer science interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation by bringing together undergraduate and graduate student researchers. As such, it aims to train a new generation of students in scientific methods. Second, the findings will illuminate why some nonprofits are less likely to be supported by public funding thus allowing policymakers to make informed decisions about which social issues could be turned over to private funding sources and which will continue to need taxpayer support. Third, as companies seek to improve relationships with consumers and limit risk exposure from activists, the findings will offer industry leaders information regarding how communication influences stakeholders support of partnerships."

Despite this importance, however, entrepreneurship research has only recently expanded beyond studying precursor conditions (such as entrepreneurial personality traits and untapped market opportunities) to address the process of starting a business--developing a business model, incorporating, registering intellectual property, making first hires, and so on.  The present project seeks to map the field of start-up activities and to identify the common pathways that nascent entrepreneurial ventures follow in transiting that field.  The PI hypothesizes (a) that start-up trajectories cluster into distinct archetypes; (b) that the choice of archetype depends on identifiable attributes of the founding team, the new firm, and the social context; and (c) that different start-up sequences will yield different outcomes, depending on these team, firm, and context contingencies.  If confirmed, these predictions would represent a significant advance over current ""one size fits all"" models of the start-up process. Such a shift would have a transformative impact on science, teaching, practice and policy in the field of entrepreneurship.<br/><br/>This project advances the entrepreneurship literature's recent turn toward ""process studies"" that explore the contingent, unfolding nature of new firm emergence.  Applying a set of under-utilized statistical techniques to data on the timing of 36 start-up activities recorded by the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED I and II), the investigation seeks to identify temporal patterns in the early trajectories of nascent entrepreneurial ventures.  First, the project will adapt multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques from psychometry to map the set of start-up activities onto a multi-dimensional activity space, based on various measures of the activities' temporal similarity to one another.  Second, the project will adapt sequence analysis (SA) techniques from genomics to cluster the observed start-up sequences into a limited number of archetypal trajectories through the activity space.  Third, the project will assess the impact of exogenous conditions such as founder attributes, organization type, and environmental context in determining a new venture's particular trajectory.  Fourth, the project will evaluate the interactive impact of these exogenous contingencies and archetypal trajectories in shaping the new venture's survival and performance outcomes.  In furtherance of these analyses, the project will refine MDS and SA methodologies to better accommodate the unique features of social-scientific data such as the activity sequences in the PSED.  The project will also supplement the existing PSED data sets with new measures of socio-political and economic conditions in respondents' environments. These new methods and variables will enhance the PSED's usefulness as a data infrastructure for exploring social vs. economic, local vs. global, and objective vs. subjective environmental influences on the start-up process, both for the current investigation and for other investigations in years to come."

One major reason for this shift toward larger social networks as solvers of scientific problems is that problems are becoming increasingly complex and require different areas of expertise, making them too difficult for individuals to solve alone. Although there is great potential for the use of networks of individuals and teams in the pursuit of science, they require individuals to navigate through the interpersonal complexities of those networks. Such complexities are especially evident when one considers that individuals, in order to accomplish their work, may be connected or tied not only to others working in the same organization, but also to others working in different organizations. With this in mind, the purpose of this research is to understand how the quantity, quality, and composition of individuals' internal and external ties influence performance in a scientific context, with a particular emphasis on the ways in which external ties facilitate or hinder the effects of internal ties on performance. Understanding the joint influence of internal and external social network ties not only has the potential to promote the progress of science, but it also has implications for contexts outside of science collaboration. For example, the knowledge generated by this research will have implications for medical care, which is increasingly provided by networks of individuals and teams, business organizations, which are utilizing teams that transcend the boundaries of a single organization, and the military, with its use of Joint Forces and Combined Operations.  <br/><br/>Via survey methodology, this research will generate data from a sample of scientists on their internal ties and external ties to other scientists working in particle physics facilities throughout the U.S. system of federally funded laboratories. To avoid limitations associated with self-report, the investigators will attempt to corroborate external ties reported by focal individuals with reports from internal ties. By identifying the quantity and quality of external, boundary spanning ties within the larger scientific ecosystem, the investigators will be able to examine issues such as the predictive validity of external ties relative to internal ties, whether external ties moderate the effects of internal ties on measures of performance, and whether the composition of external ties results in differential effects on performance, even when taking internal ties into account. In all, the initial identification of external ties, in conjunction with data on internal ties, represents an important extension because external ties may operate in a different manner relative to internal ties given that they may be characterized by (a) greater geographic dispersion, (b) higher levels of goal misalignment between teams, (c) less diversity because of the voluntary nature of external ties, and (d) less face-to-face interaction, depending upon the level of communication technology."

Although punitive policies may reduce the base-rate of ethical violations, they may paradoxically increase major ethical infractions by discouraging employees' willingness to report violations. This phenomenon is referred to as confessional reluctance, defined as the resistance to disclosing ethical violations to peers and supervisors. Confessional reluctance could turn minor ethical violations into major ethical catastrophes, as organization members seek to cover-up their mistakes through deception, falsification of records, and other means. This research project will examine confessional reluctance across several studies with multiple methods, including archival, experimental and a real-world field study. This research is important because understanding and preventing organizational ethical catastrophes is essential to a functioning society. Ethical breaches take economic and social tolls among the general public, corporations and governments. By identifying a new way of understanding major ethical breaches, our research will suggest actionable strategies for decreasing them, including employee selection, improving work-team functioning, and implementing more proactive organizational ethical climates. Ultimately, this research will provide a straightforward and empirically-backed method for making organizations more ethical.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>This project proposes a multilevel model linking punitive ethical climates, confessional reluctance and unethical escalation, and test it through archival, field and experimental studies.  To better understand confessional reluctance - and to enable interventions to reduce it - this research also identify learning climate, team/lead-member exchange and prosocial motivation as key moderators of the punitiveness-confessional reluctance relationship. Study 1 provides preliminary evidence for confessional reluctance and its link to punitive ethical climates through an online survey. Studies 2, 3 and 4 examine the link between confessional reluctance, punitive ethical climate and the escalation of unethical behavior through experimental studies. Study 4 uses company annual reports to examine the link between punitive policies and major ethical infractions, and Study 5 provides a longitudinal test of the model in the field. This research extends the literature by combining organizational variables (i.e., climate) and individual variables (i.e., prosocial motivation) into a multilevel framework. Our approach harnesses the complementary strengths of different methodologies, including the control of the lab, the realism of archival studies, and the generalizability of field samples. The lab studies provide rigorous manipulations of punitive climate with realistic simulations of organizational behavior and behavioral measures of ethical violations and confessional reluctance. The archival study extends our model to a range of companies, and the longitudinal field study examines our full model across branches of a corporation. Our interdisciplinary approach uses the tools of organizational behavior and experimental social psychology to extend our understanding of ethical behavior. Our model is particularly transformative because it contradicts basic intuitions about management. An understandable reaction to ethical breaches is to make an ethical climate more punitive, but this can paradoxically make major ethical violations more likely. Therefore, this research suggests a concrete intervention for making organizations more ethical."

A gender gap among star performers is more damaging in terms of precluding the advancement of women than a gender gap regarding average performers because stars are mentors and role models for others. Moreover, interventions aimed at reducing the performance gender gap among star performers are likely to trickle down to those lower in the performance distribution. We currently do not know whether the distributions of female and male star performers differ, which is a critical knowledge gap because such differences would be indicative of different generative mechanisms and organizational and contextual factors that lead to those differences. The proposed research agenda uses conceptual frameworks and methodological tools originally developed in other fields (e.g., physics, zoology, biology, computer science) to investigate the shape of the distribution of female and male star performers in STEM fields. Three studies will be conducted, including star researchers who are in the fields of Mathematics, Material Sciences, and Genetics. This three-study research agenda will make manifold contributions to the scientific literature concerning the science of organizations and the science of broadening participation. The findings will be used to help inform and stimulate ways in which participation in STEM fields can be broadened in general and ways to advance the careers of women. Moreover, because scripts and programs to measure the shape of the distributions will be produced, the findings of this project will pave the way for future research streams examining the shape of the performance distribution for women and men in other industries and occupations.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>Star performers are those individuals who produce output and results many times greater than the rest of the individuals holding the same job or position. The presence of stars negates the long-held assumption that individual performance follows a normal distribution. This project proposes a research program involving three studies whose goal is to understand the potential gender performance gaps among star performers. The studies will use a methodological approach that is novel in science of organizations research, but has been used in the field of physics. The first step in the analysis will include determining for each gender-based distribution the best-fit model among the following theoretical distributions: (a) normal, (a) exponential, (c) lognormal, (d) pure power law, (e) power law with exponential cutoff, (f) Weibull, and (g) Poisson. Objective measures of performance (i.e., number of articles published in scientific journals in STEM fields) will be used. Star performers are particularly visible and influential. Thus, understanding differences in the distribution of female and male star performers, and linking those differences to underlying generative factors that produce them, will offer important insights into how and why gender-based differences emerge. Findings from the three-study research agenda using theoretical frameworks and methodological tools developed in fields outside of the science of organizations will allow gaining unique insights into the factors influencing the performance of female and male star performers in STEM fields. Expected outcomes include a theory-based understanding of generative mechanisms associated with each type of distribution for female and male star performers and differential mechanisms responsible for producing female and male star performers. Results will also include new methodological tools to facilitate future research in other industries and performance domains."

This pressure comes from a variety of stakeholders, including employees, consumers, interest groups, and various industry and regulatory bodies. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) comes in many forms, including corporate philanthropy, volunteerism programs, compliance to voluntary codes of conduct, environmental sustainability initiatives, and personnel practices focused on diversity, fairness, and well-being. CSR has become both ubiquitous and entrenched within firm practices, and therefore represents a major operational consideration for organizations. Despite the omnipresence of CSR within organizations, as well as the increasing demand for CSR among stakeholders, there lacks a robust scientific literature focused particularly on the various multilevel influences involved in CSR decision making, implementation, participation, and evaluation. That is, whereas CSR research has largely focused on the relationship between firm social performance and economic performance, as well as the sociological predictors and outcomes of CSR, far less attention has been placed on the structural characteristics of CSR initiatives, as well as psychological phenomena influencing socially responsible and irresponsible behaviors within organizations. This includes a) the motives of leaders and top management teams in building CSR portfolios; b) the drivers of employee compliance with, advocacy for, and/or participation in CSR initiatives; c) the mechanisms by which firm-level CSR actions influence the attitudes and behaviors of organizational members; and d) the impact of CSR initiatives on society. The rich literatures on motivation, decision-making, pro-social behavior, ethics, program evaluation, etc. can be fruitfully applied to more fully understand CSR phenomena. The purpose of the proposed workshop is to identify key conceptual rifts, integrate diverse perspectives, and develop a research agenda focused on ""micro"" CSR processes, as well as CSR research that is both multi-disciplinary and multilevel in nature. As CSR activities connect organizations to government agencies and other regulatory bodies, a more integrated and multilevel understanding of CSR can aid understanding and facilitation of relations between the public and private sectors. Discoveries in this area can also help to facilitate diversity, fairness, and health within organizations and society at large. <br/><br/>Technical Description    <br/><br/>The proposed workshop will bring together leading corporate social responsibility (CSR) scholars with scholars from other areas within the organizational sciences (e.g., leadership, individual differences, cross-cultural psychology, human resource management, humanitarian work psychology, occupational health psychology, diversity). The lack of direct communication among these sets of researchers is unfortunate insofar as work from both groups can meaningfully contribute to the other. The focus will be on cross-pollination, as well as the sharing and joint-development of new ideas. The workshop will include keynote presentations, topical presentations, facilitated discussions, group work, multidisciplinary discussant comments, and networking opportunities. A key goal will be the identification of new directions for research in this area, the catalyzing of new collaborative and multidisciplinary projects among scholars who might otherwise remain isolated from one another, and the application of advanced research methodologies that have yet to be applied within this domain. Publically disseminated workshop outcomes will include a) a workshop website, containing the program, speaker bios, and where permitted, presentation materials and recordings; b) a press release with information about the event and the link to all of the corresponding materials, c) an overall report summarizing the conclusions, recommendations, and agenda items generated throughout the workshop."

This assumption has driven both theory and practice in the areas of employee selection, promotion, and team assembly. However, more recent theories have suggested that at extreme levels these desirable traits can result in sub-optimal performance, consistent with other work linking extreme levels of adaptive traits (e.g., conscientiousness) to maladaptive traits (e.g., obsessive compulsion). Despite convincing theoretical arguments, studies testing for such relations between personality traits and job performance have been mixed. These mixed results represent a serious challenge for both our understanding of behavior in the workplace and can have deleterious effects on the quality of decisions made by organizations. This research clarifies this relationship through two overlooked means. First, the research capitalizes on recent advances in the measurement of personality by using statistical algorithms that have been shown to more accurately distinguish persons with moderately high levels of personality traits from those with extreme levels of those traits. By utilizing these algorithms to both develop personality measures and index persons? levels of personality traits, the idea that extreme trait levels can result in sub-optimal human performance can be more accurately tested. Second, the research integrates this methodological advance with theoretical advances in the person-situation interaction by considering the degree to which the relevance of a given personality trait to the desired performance behaviors of the particular job in which they are working. For example, although extreme extraversion may be adaptive in jobs with a high social orientation (e.g., sales), it may result in maladaptive behaviors in jobs that are lower in social orientation (e.g., engineer). Finally, this research extends empirical work regarding the influence of extreme levels of desirable traits to the team context, an area that has been greatly under-studied and has also shown inconsistent empirical results. This research has a large impact on both the scientific study and practical application of the link between personality and behavior. Long-standing assumptions that seemingly-desirable traits always contribute to increased performance have largely informed our understanding of personality in the workplace and our use of personality tests for organizational decision-making. This research greatly increases the accuracy of scientist and practitioner communities? activities surrounding the areas of personality and workplace behavior, employee selection, team assembly, and personality measurement.<br/><br/>This research utilizes two basic data sources. First, Procter & Gamble has supplied the research team with a large dataset including performance metrics, job titles, and responses to personality surveys that were designed to conform to ideal point models, a statistical test-scoring algorithm that results in more accurate distinction between extreme- and moderately-high levels of personality traits. This research utilizes these data to test for curvilinear relations between various personality traits and dimensions of job performance. In particular, this research tests the hypothesis that when the relevance of a particular personality trait for the persons? occupation is high, extreme levels of that trait are beneficial, resulting in a linear relationship. However, when the relevance of that particular trait to performance is only moderately high, then a moderate level of the trait is optimal for performance, whereas extreme levels of the trait result in sub-optimal performance, resulting in curvilinear relationship. When trait relevance is low, the personality trait is expected to be irrelevant to performance, resulting in a null relationship. This research integrates perspectives on curvilinear personality-performance relationships with those on the person-situation interaction, such as trait activation theory. Second, this research tests this hypothesis in large samples of adult workers using more faceted measures of personality to replicate and extend the test of this hypothesis in more representative samples. These data collections also serve the purpose of the development and free dissemination of measures developed and scored according to the more accurate ideal point scaling approach, and the development of a software program that allows researchers to easily implement the appropriate scoring for these measures in small samples, which currently requires large sample sizes and high quantitative expertise. Finally, this research capitalizes on collaboration between personality researchers and experts on team assembly to acquire and utilize lab and field samples of work teams to extend the research on curvilinear personality-performance relations to the team composition context. This research represents a major development in uncovering the true functional form of the personality-performance relationship and specifying its dependence on context. By integrating recent advances in methodological and theoretical perspectives on personality and leveraging this integration across multiple contexts, the research represents an important step forward in our theoretical and practical understanding of the operation of personality traits in organizational settings and provides researchers and practitioners with the tools to continue to generate innovations in this area of scientific inquiry."

A gender gap among star performers is more damaging in terms of precluding the advancement of women than a gender gap regarding average performers because stars are mentors and role models for others. Moreover, interventions aimed at reducing the performance gender gap among star performers are likely to trickle down to those lower in the performance distribution. We currently do not know whether the distributions of female and male star performers differ, which is a critical knowledge gap because such differences would be indicative of different generative mechanisms and organizational and contextual factors that lead to those differences. The proposed research agenda uses conceptual frameworks and methodological tools originally developed in other fields (e.g., physics, zoology, biology, computer science) to investigate the shape of the distribution of female and male star performers in STEM fields. Three studies will be conducted, including star researchers who are in the fields of Mathematics, Material Sciences, and Genetics. This three-study research agenda will make manifold contributions to the scientific literature concerning the science of organizations and the science of broadening participation. The findings will be used to help inform and stimulate ways in which participation in STEM fields can be broadened in general and ways to advance the careers of women. Moreover, because scripts and programs to measure the shape of the distributions will be produced, the findings of this project will pave the way for future research streams examining the shape of the performance distribution for women and men in other industries and occupations.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>Star performers are those individuals who produce output and results many times greater than the rest of the individuals holding the same job or position. The presence of stars negates the long-held assumption that individual performance follows a normal distribution. This project proposes a research program involving three studies whose goal is to understand the potential gender performance gaps among star performers. The studies will use a methodological approach that is novel in science of organizations research, but has been used in the field of physics. The first step in the analysis will include determining for each gender-based distribution the best-fit model among the following theoretical distributions: (a) normal, (a) exponential, (c) lognormal, (d) pure power law, (e) power law with exponential cutoff, (f) Weibull, and (g) Poisson. Objective measures of performance (i.e., number of articles published in scientific journals in STEM fields) will be used. Star performers are particularly visible and influential. Thus, understanding differences in the distribution of female and male star performers, and linking those differences to underlying generative factors that produce them, will offer important insights into how and why gender-based differences emerge. Findings from the three-study research agenda using theoretical frameworks and methodological tools developed in fields outside of the science of organizations will allow gaining unique insights into the factors influencing the performance of female and male star performers in STEM fields. Expected outcomes include a theory-based understanding of generative mechanisms associated with each type of distribution for female and male star performers and differential mechanisms responsible for producing female and male star performers. Results will also include new methodological tools to facilitate future research in other industries and performance domains."

This complexity often hides the locus of decision making, raising key problems of accountability for citizens and interest groups of all kinds. Public policy governance systems offer important opportunities to understand these dynamics and their consequences, because public policy by nature attempts to adjudicate among competing interests to produce some form of public good.  This project examines legislators' decisions to allocate public funds to private nonprofit organizations that provide social services in a large city.  As the proportion of publicly-supported welfare services privately provided has grown, nonprofit organizations increasingly mediate the relationship between local legislators and their constituencies. In turn, nonprofits have become increasingly dependent on government contracts, leaving the amount and quality of public services that citizens experience greatly affected by nonprofits' location and capacity to attract funding. <br/><br/>How legislators allocate discretionary public funds to nonprofits reveals two key dynamics of social welfare governance: patronage relationships between legislators, their constituencies, and local nonprofits; and political exchange relationships between legislators. Patronage involves delivering and claiming credit for public resources allocated to a legislator's district. Presumably, the reward for successful patronage is re-election by one's constituents.  Political exchange involves deals cut among legislators that lead to the allocation of public resources to a legislator's district, and/or to specific votes on legislation. Focusing on the network structure produced by this governance system and its consequences for specific citizen constituencies, this project asks: (1) What is the structure of patronage relationships between municipal legislators and their district constituencies? And how does it relate to the re-election prospects of municipal legislators, the growth of nonprofit organizations, and citizens' needs? (2) What is the structure of political exchange relationships among municipal legislators? And what are legislators' individual and district characteristics that make them more likely to initiate and reciprocate exchange patterns? (3) How does the structure of political exchange relate to whether consequential legislative proposals are passed?<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This project contributes to three distinct literatures: (1) By studying sociological processes through a social network approach, it provides a contemporary picture of patronage patterns at the community level, assesses the mutual dependence of legislators and nonprofit organizations, and evaluates the distributive consequences for citizens' welfare. (2) Public administration scholars are concerned with the relative balance of managerial best practices and distributional equity in state administration. This is the first study that examines how patronage fits into a larger system of merit-based public service contracting. (3) This project also advances political science's understanding of distributive politics by disentangling mechanisms of patronage and exchange at the local level.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: In conjunction with prior NSF-funded work, this project will allow comparison of 3 mechanisms of public resource allocation to nonprofit organizations: patronage, political exchange, and competition. Project results will be communicated via a written policy brief and presentations to audiences in government, the nonprofit sector, and the media. The dataset resulted from the project will offer an important resource to scholars, practitioners, and government officials. It also provides a model set of procedures for constructing datasets for other cities or states that have similar discretionary forms of public resource allocation."
