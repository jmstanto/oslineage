Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, is redefining manufacturing in ways that make it increasingly accessible to the average citizen.  It is also deeply connected through digital platforms and the Internet.  This connectivity provides opportunities, such as allowing design of parts to happen in one place and 3D printing of the parts to happen elsewhere.  However, this connectivity has also exposed additive manufacturing to cyber-threats.  Reportedly, manufacturing is the leading target for infrastructure-related cyberattacks, sustaining even more of these attacks than the energy and utilities sectors.  Therefore,  it is critical  to national security and the nation's financial growth to educate the next generation of engineers, computer scientists, and other STEM professionals about cybersecurity for additive manufacturing. Future STEM professionals will be needed who can detect, address, and prevent additive manufacturing cyberattacks.  To support education in cybersecurity-additive manufacturing, this project includes the use of virtual reality, an emergent technology with increasing uses in eduation.  Fueled by powerful computing that can simulate nearly unlimited environments, virtual reality allows students to access and explore environments that, historically, have only been available for passive viewing in images and videos.  This Engaged Student Learning project at Southern University Baton Rouge, a Historically Black College/University, explores using multiple forms of virtual reality to educate students to identify and resolve cybersecurity threats in additive manufacturing.     <br/> <br/>Both the development and use of technology such as additive manufacturing, and the development of solutions to complex open-ended problems such as cybersecurity-additive manufacturing require deep knowledge and higher-order thinking skills.  Thus, in addition to developing a cybersecurity-additive manufacturing curriculum, this project also aims to study the use of virtual reality, in the cybersecurity-additive manufacturing context, to develop computational thinking.  Computational thinking is a problem-solving methodology that originated as a programming approach in computer science and is now widely recognized as an effective method for solving open-ended problems in all disciplines.  In this project, students will be exposed to virtual reality cybersecurity-additive manufacturing training  appropriate for their major and interests. The project will use the Computational Thinking Scale to survey students engaged in cybersecurity-additive manufacturing.  Administration and analysis of pre- and post-surveys should reveal computational thinking development in students exposed to virtual reality environments.  The research study also incorporates semi-structured student interviews to explore the relationship between virtual reality fidelity and scalability.  The results of the study are anticipated to identify correlations and emergent themes related to virtual reality and computational thinking.  Peer reviewed publications, presentations, a workshop, and partnership with America Makes, the national accelerator for additive manufacturing and 3D printing, will provide educators and industry access to the projects' cybersecurity-additive manufacturing curricular materials and project findings.

Cybersecurity vulnerabilities are growing at a scale and speed that strains human capacity to proactively address threats; developing AI and machine learning (ML) techniques to support prediction and detection capabilities is thus an important area of research. The HBCUs involved in AI-CyS either already have or are rapidly developing cybersecurity research capacity that would be further developed by increasing student and faculty involvement and training. To develop that potential, the project team will leverage its existing research activities and collaborations to deepen relationships with both other HBCUs and with the NRLs. The NRLs will provide additional research resources and mentoring through both regular remote meetings and on-site visits to the NRLs around projects of mutual interest, and opportunities for student internships and faculty visits at the NRLs. The team will also work to expand the impact of the partnership by (a) hosting an annual research conference to bring researchers together across the partners, (b) adding additional research projects, HBCUs and national lab partners with complementary research and educational interests to the existing partnership, and (c) developing cross-university curricula and mentoring programs to train HBCU students to be future research and workforce leaders in cybersecurity. Together, these efforts will advance research in cybersecurity, research capacity at the partner institutions, and research and educational opportunities for students at HBCUs, who are often members of underrepresented groups in computing. <br/><br/>The partnership will be organized around five seed research projects chosen to maximize existing capacity and collaborations. The first will use reinforcement learning to improve target selection by current autonomous network mapping software agents. The second involves analyzing network traceroute data to better understand and work around limitations of its ability to map paths in order to better detect and classify network anomalies. The third focuses on developing, then defending against, adversarial attacks on computer vision algorithms in which attackers add visual patches to objects to fool object detection and classification tools. The fourth will analyze existing tools and algorithms for generating ?deepfake? videos to develop methods to detect forged video in near real-time, with applications to surveillance and authentication tasks. The fifth will extend probabilistic sequential models to develop threat detectors at multiple levels of the network stack in the context of Internet of Things devices. Beyond these specific seed research projects, the project team will also analyze its activities to develop evidence-based best practices for research capacity-building efforts. These efforts will include developing mechanisms to expand current collaborations and foster resources, sharing expertise between HBCU members, and hosting an annual research conference that allows faculty and students from both current and potential partner HBCUs to showcase their cybersecurity research and create connections to other researchers and resources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning-based tools can help human analysts sort through large volumes of data to determine if an attack on these systems has happened.  Yet, AI components are also vulnerable to attacks, and require development of techniques to make them more robust. This collaborative project between the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) and the University of Illinois addresses the research and educational aspects of combining AI and cybersecurity. Educational and training materials will be developed for use by college and university instructors and students and by cybersecurity and AI professionals. These materials will address how AI can improve security systems and how cybersecurity analytics can protect AI systems. In addition, the project will recruit students from groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in computing. <br/><br/>This project has three interrelated topics. The first focuses on education and extends the project team?s existing cybersecurity concept inventory to include relevant AI-related concepts. Student knowledge and understanding of cybersecurity and AI relatedness will be assessed before and after taking AI or cybersecurity courses.  Educational materials and projects  will also be created to demonstrate  how AI can be applied to cybersecurity problems and how cybersecurity tools can protect AI systems from attack. The second topic explores how the latest AI tools can support cybersecurity tasks. The creation and maintenance of semantic knowledge graphs of cyberthreat information will be studied and used to support reinforcement learning systems that are better at detecting the presence of malware in a host. The third topic focuses on finding new ways that cybersecurity tools can protect AI systems from becoming compromised by attacks such as data poisoning. Cyberthreat knowledge graphs and neural networks will be used to detect and eliminate likely disinformation from data used to train AI-based cybersecurity systems. This aspect of the project has applications beyond cybersecurity, such as countering disinformation. <br/><br/>This project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education. The SaTC program aligns with the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan and the National Privacy Research Strategy to protect and preserve the growing social and economic benefits of cyber systems while ensuring security and privacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While connectivity forms the backbone in realizing SM, it has opened new cybersecurity risks and challenges, requiring a fundamental rethink and foundational efforts to tackle these challenges. Recent National Science Foundation-sponsored workshops have underscored a compelling need for a research infrastructure that can bridge the traditional divide between manufacturing and cybersecurity professionals and foster a community of CISE experts in manufacturing cybersecurity. Creating such an infrastructure is essential to understand the cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and to develop solutions tailored to SM systems. This project envisions the creation of a vibrant CISE research community for data-driven cybersecurity for SM by launching a community research platform integrating three elements: (1) A web infrastructure that enables virtual ?playgrounds? to share data, codes, resources, and tools, mostly contributed by the research community? (2) a data infrastructure for curating diverse cybersecurity datasets? and (3) a SM machine infrastructure that will leverage established national resources, including the Smart Manufacturing Innovation Platform from the Department of Energy. Taken together, this infrastructure will help CISE researchers to collaborate with the SM community ?spanning academia, industry, and government? to create and share data for understanding the vulnerabilities of a network of SM machines and other components of a manufacturing enterprise, and facilitate the development of AI-driven cybersecurity innovations for SM. This infrastructure will enable CISE-relevant, data-driven research thrusts spanning five key SM system elements: (1) Cybersecurity by design; (2) compiler optimizations for SM process plans and toolpaths; (3) forensics and watermarking of SM machines; (4) protections against SM process-unique side-channels; and (5) fingerprinting and securing SM networks. The community will be able to contribute their SM equipment, relevant hardware and software components, data, and innovations to grow this networked cyber-physical platform infrastructure.<br/> <br/>Emerging manufacturing enterprises are increasingly adopting advanced sensor and AI technologies and transforming themselves into smart manufacturing systems. These smart systems can connect multiple manufacturers, designers, and businesses to efficiently meet customer demands. A SM network is noted by IBM as the largest target for cybersecurity attacks among all industry sectors. Securing such a network is a daunting task. This project aims to create an online resource consisting of web infrastructure, data, and machines to bring together professionals from the manufacturing and cybersecurity communities. This infrastructure will enhance collaborations among these communities to enable a deeper understanding of current and emerging cybersecurity threats to smart manufacturing environments and enable the development of innovations to assure cybersecurity within the smart manufacturing sector. It will particularly benefit diverse researchers, practitioners, and students from cybersecurity, AI, and manufacturing disciplines. For example, the project will leverage the Inclusive Engineering Consortium, a network of 20 Underrepresented Minority serving engineering colleges to enable broad-based impact.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This effort addresses issues such as data governance, compliance, data protection, and security and privacy management capabilities. In collaboration with cybersecurity professionals representing organizations at both the national and regional levels, cybersecurity service providers, and industry experts, AIHEC is developing a networked TCU cybersecurity community of practice (CoP) and a Networked Improvement Community (NIC) as the seminal aspect of this effort to support cybersecurity capacity building and sustainability. In addition to growing a TCU CI/cybersecurity CoP and NIC, AIHEC is advising the TCUs in making informed decisions when selecting providers and partners to support and strengthening their cybersecurity position and reducing their risk profile. Experiences and best practices are shared through the TCU CI/cybersecurity CoP, thus leveraging TCU experiences and lessons learned. <br/><br/>The TCUs have small, under-resourced IT departments too limited to assess, secure, and monitor the network vulnerabilities that expose the education and research missions of the institution. This state puts their entire curriculum, including STEM and language and culture preservation, at risk for security breaches. As part of this initiative, AIHEC is developing shared resources such as a TCU-specific cybersecurity assessment framework and supporting the development of a virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) and virtual Security Operations Center (vSOC) at a TCU through the CI/Cybersecurity CoP. In addition to creating a more secure and aware environment, these enhancements will allow TCU administration, faculty and staff to increase their focus on the academic and research missions of their institutions. A cybersecurity strategy that guides the entire TCU community in a comprehensive short and long-term, cybersecurity posture will lower the TCU community?s threat level.

Keeping computers and information systems secure is a critical need and a major challenge in business, industry, and government. The growth of cyber-threats has created a need for many more workers who have the knowledge and skills to protect both existing and emerging technologies. The use of challenges, competitions, games, puzzles, and similar highly interactive and team-oriented activities has proved to be an effective means of exciting students about cybersecurity and improving their understanding of cybersecurity concepts. These tools can supplement traditional pedagogical approaches, and they can sometimes engage students that the traditional approaches do not. In this project, educators from Sinclair Community College and Moraine Valley Community College will refine, test, and disseminate a hands-on, minds-on learning game called ""Sticker Heist,"" in which teams of students solve cybersecurity puzzles to complete the shared quest of opening a locked box to retrieve ""stickers."" This quest is supported by an immersive story that locates the players in an alternate time and identity. This cybersecurity simulation game encourages teamwork, communication, and leadership while it teaches principles and skills in the cybersecurity curriculum. Role-playing and simulation games, especially escape games like ""Sticker Heist,"" are broadly appealing to people of various ages, educational backgrounds, races, and genders and can be used to expose people of all ages to new career fields, especially cybersecurity and other areas of STEM. The learning activities in this project will increase students' engagement, promote learning outcomes, support recruitment into the cybersecurity profession by encouraging participants to picture themselves in a cybersecurity career, and address the critical need to attract more students from underrepresented populations into the cybersecurity workforce.<br/><br/>""Sticker Heist"" is a hands-on learning game that consists of a self-contained, portable security system protecting a locked box of laptop stickers. The interior box is a simple, locked container containing a number of laptop stickers related to Defcon, hacking events, etc., which are often collectibles to enthusiasts. The surrounding box contains the systems that secure the first -- currently a Raspberry Pi 4, Arduino Uno, network, and other components (RFID, keypad, buzzer, lights). However, the box is not 100% secure; several common security flaws and vulnerabilities have been built in. This allows teams of high school and college students to work together to gather information (reconnaissance) on the system and then use free, open-source tools to expose and exploit the security flaws to access the system, open the box, and collect the prize. In this challenge, students work together as a team and think critically and creatively while learning the basics of cybersecurity. In the project, the investigators will pursue four related goals. First, is to refine the ""Sticker Heist"" learning tool, ensuring its alignment with the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework as well as industry-recognized cybersecurity credentials. Second, is to deliver professional development training on the tool to high school and college faculty so that they can effectively implement the tool in their classrooms. Third, is to promote use of the tool as a means to attract underrepresented students into cybersecurity through demonstrations, recruitment events, and clubs. Fourth, and finally, is to assess the effectiveness of the tool for improving engagement and attracting a broader and more diverse population of students to cybersecurity careers.

Cybersecurity vulnerabilities are growing at a scale and speed that strains human capacity to proactively address threats; developing AI and machine learning (ML) techniques to support prediction and detection capabilities is thus an important area of research. The HBCUs involved in AI-CyS either already have or are rapidly developing cybersecurity research capacity that would be further developed by increasing student and faculty involvement and training. To develop that potential, the project team will leverage its existing research activities and collaborations to deepen relationships with both other HBCUs and with the NRLs. The NRLs will provide additional research resources and mentoring through both regular remote meetings and on-site visits to the NRLs around projects of mutual interest, and opportunities for student internships and faculty visits at the NRLs. The team will also work to expand the impact of the partnership by (a) hosting an annual research conference to bring researchers together across the partners, (b) adding additional research projects, HBCUs and national lab partners with complementary research and educational interests to the existing partnership, and (c) developing cross-university curricula and mentoring programs to train HBCU students to be future research and workforce leaders in cybersecurity. Together, these efforts will advance research in cybersecurity, research capacity at the partner institutions, and research and educational opportunities for students at HBCUs, who are often members of underrepresented groups in computing. <br/><br/>The partnership will be organized around five seed research projects chosen to maximize existing capacity and collaborations. The first will use reinforcement learning to improve target selection by current autonomous network mapping software agents. The second involves analyzing network traceroute data to better understand and work around limitations of its ability to map paths in order to better detect and classify network anomalies. The third focuses on developing, then defending against, adversarial attacks on computer vision algorithms in which attackers add visual patches to objects to fool object detection and classification tools. The fourth will analyze existing tools and algorithms for generating ?deepfake? videos to develop methods to detect forged video in near real-time, with applications to surveillance and authentication tasks. The fifth will extend probabilistic sequential models to develop threat detectors at multiple levels of the network stack in the context of Internet of Things devices. Beyond these specific seed research projects, the project team will also analyze its activities to develop evidence-based best practices for research capacity-building efforts. These efforts will include developing mechanisms to expand current collaborations and foster resources, sharing expertise between HBCU members, and hosting an annual research conference that allows faculty and students from both current and potential partner HBCUs to showcase their cybersecurity research and create connections to other researchers and resources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While connectivity forms the backbone in realizing SM, it has opened new cybersecurity risks and challenges, requiring a fundamental rethink and foundational efforts to tackle these challenges. Recent National Science Foundation-sponsored workshops have underscored a compelling need for a research infrastructure that can bridge the traditional divide between manufacturing and cybersecurity professionals and foster a community of CISE experts in manufacturing cybersecurity. Creating such an infrastructure is essential to understand the cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and to develop solutions tailored to SM systems. This project envisions the creation of a vibrant CISE research community for data-driven cybersecurity for SM by launching a community research platform integrating three elements: (1) A web infrastructure that enables virtual ?playgrounds? to share data, codes, resources, and tools, mostly contributed by the research community? (2) a data infrastructure for curating diverse cybersecurity datasets? and (3) a SM machine infrastructure that will leverage established national resources, including the Smart Manufacturing Innovation Platform from the Department of Energy. Taken together, this infrastructure will help CISE researchers to collaborate with the SM community ?spanning academia, industry, and government? to create and share data for understanding the vulnerabilities of a network of SM machines and other components of a manufacturing enterprise, and facilitate the development of AI-driven cybersecurity innovations for SM. This infrastructure will enable CISE-relevant, data-driven research thrusts spanning five key SM system elements: (1) Cybersecurity by design; (2) compiler optimizations for SM process plans and toolpaths; (3) forensics and watermarking of SM machines; (4) protections against SM process-unique side-channels; and (5) fingerprinting and securing SM networks. The community will be able to contribute their SM equipment, relevant hardware and software components, data, and innovations to grow this networked cyber-physical platform infrastructure.<br/> <br/>Emerging manufacturing enterprises are increasingly adopting advanced sensor and AI technologies and transforming themselves into smart manufacturing systems. These smart systems can connect multiple manufacturers, designers, and businesses to efficiently meet customer demands.

Unfortunately, there are many actors ready to steal personal identities, illegally take intellectual property from U.S. companies, and even to make life difficult through interfering with energy supply chains or poisoning water resources. To ensure safety, steps are needed to make certain that there are enough superior cybersecurity experts in the government to guard against such growing threats. To maximize the impact of the cybersecurity workforce, these experts must also reflect the diversity of society including women, minorities, veterans, and those with disabilities. By way of this renewal, Marymount University will continue to recruit, educate, and place in government service, a diverse set of academically qualified individuals from a wide set of backgrounds, including community colleges. The grant will support their achievement of academic success and readiness for their placement in government service. They will be provided a full scholarship (tuition and some living expenses for the final 2 years of their program) as well as a first-class educational experience (earning a BS, MS, or DSc in Cybersecurity). The program will expand their knowledge, skills, and abilities in cybersecurity so that they can protect all of society as the use of technology continues to grow. <br/><br/>This project builds on the success and experience of the previously funded SFS project and will be guided by five objectives. First, is to continue to recruit a well-qualified, diverse group of students at all levels. Second is to ensure the highest levels of development of the students for government work. Third is to retain and graduate all students with a minimum GPA of 3.5 and facilitate 100% placement in government positions. Fourth is to develop professionals capable of designing, building, and managing secure information systems for the new connected world. Finally, it is to evaluate the extent to which enhanced student-faculty interactions, mentoring, community outreach, and joint involvement in research contributes to positive workplace outcomes, particularly for the members of groups historically underrepresented in their participation in the field of cybersecurity. Marymount has increased the effectiveness and sustainability of its programs by implementing an agile curriculum process to keep pace with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing. These curriculum changes are informed by workforce studies including a detailed understanding of the federal government needs, and by alliances with larger public institutions for research and resources.

These features integrate a variety of new sensors, actuators, computer elements, communication protocols, and software. Unfortunately, this trend also has increased the vulnerability of these systems to cyber-attacks. There has been limited awareness of the cybersecurity challenges posed by automotive electronics, even within the cybersecurity research community. This project will address this crucial problem by developing an exploration platform and suite of experiments to enable the dissemination of vehicular security concepts. The platform will target multidisciplinary undergraduate students across STEM areas relevant to transportation. It can be deployed as a comprehensive hands-on lab in a course targeting vehicular security. Individual experiments can also be used in a cybersecurity, hardware security, or wireless networking course, on the one hand, and courses on vehicular systems traditionally offered in Civil and Mechanical Engineering departments on the other. Modules from the platform can also be used for training transportation engineers, vehicular electronics designers, and practitioners in the security of hardware and cyber-physical systems. The project aligns closely with the National Science Foundation's mission of achieving a ""truly secure cyberspace in today's networked, distributed, and asynchronous world."" It will facilitate the creation of a crucial workforce for robust, cyber-resilient autonomous transportation systems. Moreover, the educational materials will give students a strong competitive edge in a highly promising, emergent market and help them assume leadership roles in academia, industry, and the public sector.<br/><br/>The project has three technical objectives. First, it will create a unified exploration platform covering the spectrum of security concepts in emerging vehicular systems, including hardware, sensor, compute, network, and full platform levels. Second, it will create a vehicle for disciplined dissemination of vehicular security concepts through a hands-on learning platform. The students will get a chance not just to comprehend known attacks but also to discover new attacks and defenses.

This proposal builds upon theories of risk communication, emotional intelligence, and self-determination to design new approaches to cybersecurity risk communication and training. The goals are to enable users to assess risks, costs, and benefits consistently and correctly, to promote task-focused coping responses, and to facilitate their internalization of values, promoting spontaneous diffusion of cybersecurity knowledge. By enabling non-expert users to make informed security decisions through raising cybersecurity risk awareness and self-efficacy development, this project directly addresses an increasingly serious threat to economic growth and national security. This project also creates cybersecurity research and training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, and members from the underrepresented groups through outreach initiatives.<br/><br/>This project systematically tests two hypotheses: (i) that addressing gaps in mental models along with development of self-efficacy can promote task-focused coping responses and early conformance behavior, and (ii) that communicating social motives can lead to the development of intrinsic motivation and spontaneous diffusion of information. Towards that end, the researchers design and conduct a series of interview-style user studies including both expert and non-expert users, and they develop effective risk communication modules that address gaps in mental models and enable non-expert users to evaluate risks, costs and benefits of security decisions. This project will also test the efficacy of different interventions  to promote task-focused coping responses and promote spontaneous diffusion of information. By systematically testing the aforementioned hypotheses, this project provides in-depth understanding regarding the influence of emotions and social motives in cybersecurity behavior and makes a valuable contribution to the theoretical foundation of risk communication. By investigating mental models of high school students as well as adults, this project advances the theory of risk communication for adolescents in the cybersecurity context and enables cybersecurity professionals to design risk communication modules specifically targeting this vulnerable demographic.

This project is led by the Borough of Manhattan Community College, a Hispanic-serving institution in which more than 75% of the students are from communities that are not yet equitably represented in STEM or in cybersecurity fields.  Thus, by providing training that can lead to high-paying, stable jobs, this project will help to mitigate the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on the communities that the College serves.<br/><br/>The certificate program will target high school students and incumbent workers. By mapping stackable credentials, such as industry certifications or prior experiences, to credit-bearing college courses, the certificate program intends to increase timely completion. The curriculum will consist of 30 college course credits.  Thus, individuals who earn the certificate will have the flexibility of entering the workforce directly or continuing their studies to earn advanced credentials including a college degree. In creating the certificate program, the project will modify current face-to-face cybersecurity courses for delivery online. By offering these courses online, the certificate program will accommodate individual schedules and travel limitations, thus enabling more individuals to participate. To help participants gain knowledge about the industry, the certificate program will include enrichment activities, such as summer bridge courses, industry certification workshops, and panel discussions with career professionals. Throughout development of the certificate program, the project team will adopt or adapt materials from ATE Cybersecurity Centers, including curricular materials and faculty development activities.  In addition, by sharing the new materials developed by the project with the cybersecurity community, the project will contribute to the cybersecurity education knowledge base. The project will benefit incumbent workers who need new skills as well as high school students who want to enter information technology fields after graduation. Incumbent workers will gain valuable contacts with industry leaders through the project?s Advisory Board, while the dual enrollment certificate courses will help prepare high school students for both cybersecurity careers and college. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation?s economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such underrepresentation could lead to reduced opportunities in S&E in which cybersecurity skills are developed. Thus, this research focuses on cybersecurity awareness concerning the appropriate use and management of identity credentials for user authentication. This focus is important as credential-related account compromises are among the most common types of cyberattacks, while members of historically excluded racial and ethnic groups are more frequently targeted by cyberattacks. Further, while research on inclusive authentication is growing, inclusive user authentication schemes for historically excluded racial and ethnic groups are understudied. Through integrated research and education activities, this project develops novel, inclusive user authentication systems to reduce cybersecurity risk, with race and ethnicity central foci. Outcomes of this project also provide cybersecurity-focused education material for K-12 and university students and the broader population, thereby expanding the nation's cybersecurity defense.<br/><br/>This project engages individuals from historically excluded racial and ethnic groups in S&E to inform the design, implementation, and appropriate use of inclusive authentication systems. The research team is conducting a series of focus groups to identify current use and perceptions of existing authentication systems, how various cybersecurity practices are applied in everyday life, and how various factors, including racial equity and cultural values, shape perceptions of computing and cybersecurity. Performance of authentication systems, including knowledge-based and AI-derived biometric systems, is also investigated to identify data-driven and algorithmic biases. This performance analysis is facilitated through a multi-session data collection, through which mock credentials and physical and behavioral biometric cues are gathered from volunteering research participants. With these insights and data, novel authentication systems that address poor generalization, failure trends, and authentication errors associated with subgroups of users, the authentication type, or the authentication model are developed using a variety of approaches, including soft biometric classification, feature selection, and multimodal fusion. This CAREER project informs the design and implementation of authentication systems that contribute to inclusive and accessible cybersecurity solutions, transforms state-of-the-art authentication systems by exposing when and how they isolate certain groups and identifying biases in knowledge and biometric-based authentication systems, contributes a novel, diverse dataset for cybersecurity research, and informs future directions for inclusive identity and access management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While connectivity forms the backbone in realizing SM, it has opened new cybersecurity risks and challenges, requiring a fundamental rethink and foundational efforts to tackle these challenges. Recent National Science Foundation-sponsored workshops have underscored a compelling need for a research infrastructure that can bridge the traditional divide between manufacturing and cybersecurity professionals and foster a community of CISE experts in manufacturing cybersecurity. Creating such an infrastructure is essential to understand the cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and to develop solutions tailored to SM systems. This project envisions the creation of a vibrant CISE research community for data-driven cybersecurity for SM by launching a community research platform integrating three elements: (1) A web infrastructure that enables virtual ?playgrounds? to share data, codes, resources, and tools, mostly contributed by the research community? (2) a data infrastructure for curating diverse cybersecurity datasets? and (3) a SM machine infrastructure that will leverage established national resources, including the Smart Manufacturing Innovation Platform from the Department of Energy. Taken together, this infrastructure will help CISE researchers to collaborate with the SM community ?spanning academia, industry, and government? to create and share data for understanding the vulnerabilities of a network of SM machines and other components of a manufacturing enterprise, and facilitate the development of AI-driven cybersecurity innovations for SM. This infrastructure will enable CISE-relevant, data-driven research thrusts spanning five key SM system elements: (1) Cybersecurity by design; (2) compiler optimizations for SM process plans and toolpaths; (3) forensics and watermarking of SM machines; (4) protections against SM process-unique side-channels; and (5) fingerprinting and securing SM networks. The community will be able to contribute their SM equipment, relevant hardware and software components, data, and innovations to grow this networked cyber-physical platform infrastructure.<br/> <br/>Emerging manufacturing enterprises are increasingly adopting advanced sensor and AI technologies and transforming themselves into smart manufacturing systems. These smart systems can connect multiple manufacturers, designers, and businesses to efficiently meet customer demands. A SM network is noted by IBM as the largest target for cybersecurity attacks among all industry sectors. Securing such a network is a daunting task. This project aims to create an online resource consisting of web infrastructure, data, and machines to bring together professionals from the manufacturing and cybersecurity communities. This infrastructure will enhance collaborations among these communities to enable a deeper understanding of current and emerging cybersecurity threats to smart manufacturing environments and enable the development of innovations to assure cybersecurity within the smart manufacturing sector.

However, the increasing reliance of PCSs on digital communications and networking technologies, together with the growth in complexity and sophistication of cyberattack techniques, have rendered industrial PCSs vulnerable to cyberattacks by malicious agents. Cyberattacks on PCSs aim to disrupt process operations, potentially resulting in adverse effects on public safety and prosperity. The traditional approach for improving cybersecurity of PCSs involves fortifying information technology (IT) systems to prevent a cyberattacker or malicious software from gaining access to the PCS network. However, IT-based cybersecurity approaches remain vulnerable, motivating methods that account for the threat of cyberattacks directly in the PCS design and operation. In this project, computational and modeling tools will be developed to design PCS-based detection methods capable of sensing the presence of cyberattacks in industrially relevant processes to enhance the resiliency and cybersecurity of PCSs. The project findings will provide fundamental insights into which cyberattacks can be detected and how detection sensitivity is linked to PCS performance. Undergraduate and graduate student researchers will be recruited to carry out the research activities, those which include simulated cyberattacks on large-scale industrial processes. Overall, the transformative impact of this project is in its creation of a cybersecurity framework that is directly integrated into PCS design considerations and subsequent operation, driving a paradigm shift in PCS cybersecurity away from treating cyberthreats to PCSs exclusively as an IT-specific problem.<br/><br/>The increasing reliance of chemical manufacturing Process Control Systems (PCSs) on advanced communications and networking technologies and the growing sophistication of cyberattacks have rendered industrial PCSs vulnerable to attacks by malicious agents. Cyberattacks on PCSs aim to disrupt operations, destabilize processes, or cause safety incidents. Traditionally, PCS cybersecurity has been based on fortifying Information Technology (IT) systems to prevent a cyberattacker or malicious software from gaining access to the PCS network. While improving IT security will prevent some cyberattacks on PCSs, an attacker may circumvent the IT security measures over extended periods of time without the knowledge of the process operators. This fundamental limitation of IT-based cybersecurity motivates a control-based approach. In this project, active control-enabled cyberattack detection methods will be developed to signal external attacks that manipulate data communicated over the sensor-controller and controller-actuator links. The methods will incorporate cyberattack detection considerations directly in the PCS design and operation. The main research objectives of the project include a) identifying the fundamental properties of cyberattack detectability, including conditions for cyberattack detectability verification, and elucidating the role of the PCS design in cyberattack detectability, b) formulating a PCS design optimization problem that ensures detectability of cyberattacks, c) developing active cyberattack design methodologies to probe/manipulate the PCS to detect stealthy cyberattacks, and d) applying the detection methods to simulated benchmark chemical processes to demonstrate and analyze the performance of this new approach to cybersecurity. The project is expected to advance the fundamental understanding of cyberattack detectability and develop novel control-enabled software tools for cyberattack detection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Medical electronic devices cover a spectrum of equipment implementations, ranging from large diagnostic imaging machines to small mobile devices that patients carry with them. The digitized nature of modern computing platforms used in healthcare systems and their increased connectivity to computer networks have led into the growth of cybersecurity vulnerabilities making such systems a unique target for sophisticated cyber-attacks. The proposed project aims at developing effective and adaptive solutions for emerging healthcare cybersecurity challenges for securing biomedical computing platforms against potential malicious cyber-attacks. In addition, it will result in integrated engineering research projects and educational materials to mentor and train undergraduate and graduate students in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) for security analysis and biomedical hardware-assisted cybersecurity specially from Under-Represented Minorities (URM). The proposed engineering research and educational activities are planned to provide students from diverse engineering backgrounds such as computer engineering, computer science, and biomedical engineering majors with the necessary knowledge and skills to be competitive in the demanding job market where highly specialized hardware designers, AI/ML engineers, data scientists, and cybersecurity specialist are needed to develop new efficient methods for securing modern computing systems. <br/><br/>Traditionally, integrity of data being processed in computing systems has been safeguarded at the software level with the assumption that the underlying hardware is secure against potential attacks. However, biomedical devices have some unique features such as specific security requirements, implementation cost and design trade-offs characteristics, and limited resources and computational power that undermine their security protocols. In addition, strict regulations make it difficult to conduct basic software updates on medical computers and adopting off-the-shelf Anti-Virus (AV) protection is also insufficient for preventing emerging cyber-attacks such as malware. To overcome the performance overhead and inefficiency of conventional software-based solutions, the security in modern biomedical devices should be delegated to the underlying hardware, building a bottom-up solution for securing computing devices rather than treating it as an afterthought. In this project, we will leverage effective AI/ML techniques to develop accurate, low-cost, and adaptive techniques and build a multi-tiered intelligent framework for hardware-assisted cybersecurity in emerging biomedical devices. We will utilize the patterns of low-level hardware features captured by microprocessors? hardware components in biomedical devices to build novel intelligent techniques for recognizing and classifying emerging cyber-attacks (e.g., malware, side-channel attacks, stealthy attacks, zero-day attacks, etc.) with high accuracy and low computational overheads. The proposed research project targets five major objectives: 1) Comprehensive data collection, benchmarking, and feature analysis of emerging hardware-driven cyber-attacks in biomedical devices? processors, 2) Developing various standard and advanced machine learning techniques for intelligent hardware-assisted cybersecurity countermeasures using the hardware-related features, 3) Exploring hardware implementation results and on-device trade-off analysis of the intelligent hardware-assisted countermeasures, 4) Developing a reinforcement learning-based decision-maker for adaptive selection of the accurate and cost-efficient detector to facilitate online detection of the cyber-attacks, and 5) Developing a system-level ontology-based cybersecurity analysis framework for an effective automated knowledge reasoning in IoMT devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, it is quite challenging in cybersecurity to do hands-on activities that require Internet infrastructure. There is a lack of safe and effective platforms for these activities, as many cybersecurity activities cannot be carried out directly on the Internet, or they would cause real damage. Inspired by many other fields, the project team is developing an Internet emulator and then using the emulator as the lab environment for hands-on activities. With this emulator, one can create a miniature Internet inside a personal computer with all the essential elements of the Internet. The project team aims to develop a suite of hands-on labs which will enable students to experiment with techniques to combat attacks inside the emulator without causing any harm to the real world. Moreover, many notable past attacks (e.g., the Morris Worm) can be recreated inside the emulator, so students can see study the historical events and envision how to defend against these attacks. The Internet emulator and the associated lab activities can help develop a much-needed workforce in cybersecurity, especially in improving hands-on skills. <br/><br/>This project has two primary objectives: i) developing an Internet emulator that can serve as the basis for conducting hands-on exercises and ii) developing hands-on lab activities based on the emulator. This project fills a void in cybersecurity education since while there are existing network emulators, a low-cost Internet emulator designed explicitly for cybersecurity education does not exist. Moreover, there are few hands-on activities based on such emulators. With the solutions expected from this project, students can conduct lab activities, including attacks and defenses, on the Internet level, without worrying about causing real damage. Instructors will have a pool of lab activities they can choose from based on their education needs. They can also use the emulator to customize the lab environment. While this project focuses on cybersecurity education, the emulator can also be used as the base for designing lab activities in other fields, such as networking and other aspects of information technology applications. The emulator has the potential to become a successful, high-impact, and self-sustained open-source project.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education.

This University is a four-year Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institution. Over its five-year duration, the project will provide up to two years of scholarship support to 30 undergraduate juniors and transfer students who are pursuing a bachelor's degree in cybersecurity.  The Scholars will be selected in three annual cohorts.  The project aims to increase student persistence in cybersecurity by linking scholarships with effective support activities, including mentoring, cohort-based industry-relevant certification training, intensive training on a state-of-the-art cybersecurity emulator, and a structured career-launching work experience after the scholarship support ends. Mentoring/advising will include faculty mentors, student mentors, and professional advisors, with a focus on providing relevant and timely guidance that will advance Scholars? academic and career success. Examples of mentoring/advising topics include successful college student behaviors, emotional support for Scholars during transition points or times of academic/personal challenges, support activities within certification courses, and reflections on future career pathways including introductions to professionals for job shadowing. Because Metropolitan State University has a high population of underrepresented students, this project has the potential to broaden participation in the cybersecurity field and to advance knowledge about how to support retention and graduation of this student population in cybersecurity.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase cybersecurity degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. The project aims to study how outcomes such as Scholars' enrollment intensity (i.e., enrolling in a higher number of credits per year compared to peers) and self-efficacy are impacted by intensive co-curricular support and career-focused expectations. Drawing from Social Cognitive Career Theory, this project will test and contribute to the body of literature on whether co-curricular supports that explicitly target self-efficacy and outcome expectancy as drivers of personal career choice actions are effective at increasing persistence and degree completion for low-income, academically talented students in technology-rich fields.  The project aims to identify the barriers and enablers for applying to and completing the cybersecurity program. This project has the potential to generate new knowledge about the role of scholarships and enrollment intensity among low-income academically talented students with the overarching goal of understanding the factors that enable or impede cybersecurity degree attainment. The project will be evaluated using appropriate instruments to anchor the evidence triangulation process, based on artifacts from learning and teaching episodes, interviews, surveys, and focus groups. The results of this project will be disseminated through the institution website, presentations at local conferences, Minnesota State System collaboration meetings, regional and national science education conferences (e.g., Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education or SIGCSE), and articles published in peer-reviewed journals. This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Students often struggle to relate abstract concepts like the right to privacy, control over personal data, or freedom of speech, to the concrete technical choices they must make. This project realizes and evaluates a new pedagogical approach to teaching privacy and cybersecurity, focused around ""stakeholders"": people who are directly or indirectly affected by a technical system. The project's novelties are (1) the stakeholder approach, which combines teaching about abstract, high-level concepts with concrete applications, and (2) a preliminary investigation of the effectiveness of this approach. The project's broader significance and importance are that it creates an effective template for privacy and cybersecurity, produces open-source assignment materials, and impacts computer science  education through new pedagogies and curricular recommendations.<br/><br/>The project develops a new, stakeholder-focused approach to teaching privacy and security. The stakeholder approach is a template for reasoning about privacy and cybersecurity concerns in the development of technical systems, with a focus on relating high-level, abstract concepts to concrete implementation choices via stakeholder needs. The stakeholder needs give students concrete but possibly conflicting requirements to support. Ideally, the stakeholder approach leads to (a) students making deeper and more substantive connections between abstract concepts related to privacy and cybersecurity (e.g., data autonomy and ownership, transparency, accountability) and concrete social impacts (e.g., identity theft, reputational damage); (b) students engaging more deeply with social impact concepts and how they relate to technical decisions they face; and (c) students perceiving cybersecurity as an area in which they can work towards fair and equitable computing systems. The research team is developing and deploying stakeholder-based assignments in five computer science courses at Brown University, spanning introductory, intermediate, and upper-level courses taken by undergraduates and cybersecurity master's students. The data collected from these assignments will help answer the central research question of whether the stakeholder approach results in meaningful improvement in students' ability to relate normative concepts to concrete problems and technical design decisions. This work will therefore contribute to academic computer science education, workforce development, and socially-responsible computing by proposing new pedagogies and curricular structures for effective teaching of privacy and cybersecurity and their societal context.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Importantly, many of these risks go beyond narrow notions of robustness against attack to include concerns about misuse, unintended consequences, fairness across users, and other possible harms that happen when technologies are broadly used in society. This raises the need for future cybersecurity professionals to be aware of these harms and to consider ethics and responsibility of the systems they secure.  This project's goal is to help students develop an ethical and responsible mindset towards cybersecurity topics, focusing on technologies that use artificial intelligence (AI) in security and privacy use cases. To do this the project team will develop a series of case studies of AI-enabled technologies designed for social problems, helping students reason about aspects of the design that can raise or mitigate security and privacy risks. The cases will be designed to appear in a series of undergraduate and graduate cybersecurity-related courses, with the idea that repeated exposure to these topics will make ethical considerations an integral part of the security curriculum, and that seeing them in different contexts will reinforce student learning and prepare students to transfer these mindsets and skills across contexts as they enter the security workforce.<br/><br/>Using prior research on situated learning and perspectival thinking, the project team will create a series of four role-play-based case studies that highlight different social and ethical risks that often arise around AI technologies designed for security-related problems. Role-play based methods are an effective pedagogical technique for learning and perspective-taking; the team plans to combine them with a concept map-based assessment approach that is well-suited for the kind of longitudinal assessment that will be needed for a multi-course curriculum effort. Further, the concept map elicitation will be grounded in common security standards and rubrics, tightening the connection between the role-playing exercises and the security workforce development goals of the project.

Adversarial Thinking (AT) is widely recognized as a critically important ability for cybersecurity. The importance of AT has been widely discussed in the cybersecurity community, and many educators have created activities and exercises explicitly intended to strengthen AT in students to enhance their cybersecurity understanding and abilities. However, there is no broadly accepted description of AT or its components beyond describing it as the ability to ?think like an attacker."" As a result, there is no test to meaningfully quantify AT or the effectiveness of interventions designed to improve AT. To meet this important need, this foundation-building five-year project will create a description of the core components of AT. The project will use a consensus approach drawing on the knowledge and experience of a diverse group of individuals in the cybersecurity community. The project will create and validate a non-technical test for AT and use the test to 1) identify AT in individuals and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of exercises meant to improve AT. This project will shed light on fundamental knowledge about AT in cybersecurity, help identify the next generation of cybersecurity professionals, and give cybersecurity educators tools to improve the effectiveness of security education.<br/><br/>Based on the widespread belief that AT is critical for security, the hypotheses of this project are that 1) critical components of AT for cybersecurity can be identified, 2) a non-technical test can be created and validated that measures these components, 3) the test can be used to perform rigorous research about AT, and 4) this research can be integrated with and inform cybersecurity education. To test these hypotheses, the PI will work with a diverse set of cybersecurity experts in a modified Delphi process to identify and describe AT's most crucial elements and publish the results. The PI will then create, screen for bias, rigorously validate, and publish the Adversarial Thinking Assessment (ATA), an instrument to measure AT ability. The test will not require technical cybersecurity knowledge and hence can be administered broadly. Using the validated ATA, the PI will conduct experiments to identify AT ability across various groups of students and professionals. The PO will also develop and evaluate new interventions to help individuals develop AT skills. The overall project will drive an iterative, five-year AT-focused curriculum development for a sequence of two security courses at the University of Minnesota Duluth. The impact of this project is a new foundation for research around the critical concept of AT in the context of cybersecurity education. This CAREER award is supported in part by NSF's IUSE:EHR Program which supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.

These conversations will serve as a means to identify disciplinary knowledge, including needs and benefits, at the intersection of cybersecurity and AI. The group will work to identify ways to engage middle school students and their teachers in learning about AI, cybersecurity, and the intersections between them. By including this array of voices, the project will generate knowledge about the differences and similarities between industry and academic expectations. The discussion will also drive the development of a survey that can be used to determine what students know about AI and cybersecurity as well as a proof-of-concept instructional module that addresses one of the identified gaps in knowledge. The project team will also document the process for building this interdisciplinary community of practice to focus on a single issue in ways that shape students? educational experiences. The project will determine whether investing effort into deciphering what middle school students do know, and what they can know, will lead to students who are more engaged in cybersecurity and AI as citizens, users, programmers, or in other roles as they mature into adulthood.<br/><br/>The outcomes of this project will advance understanding of the nature of expertise of researchers and professionals in AI and cybersecurity, as well as supporting and studying communication between them, while exploring ways to translate that expertise into curricula for widespread dissemination to middle school teachers and students. The project team will use a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches to accomplish the following outcomes: (1) the development of an interdisciplinary think tank along with a documented process for creating it that can inform others interested in building similar partnerships; (2) the development of survey instruments designed to uncover what middle grades students understand about AI, cybersecurity, and the intersection of these two areas as they affect their lives, as well as possible careers available in this interdisciplinary space; (3) findings from the survey on possible gaps as well as what middle grades students understand about these areas; and (4) one proof-of-concept learning module that can be implemented by any middle school teacher anywhere. <br/><br/>This project is supported by a special initiative of the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program to foster new, previously unexplored, collaborations between the fields of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and education.

High-profile data breaches, ransomware attacks, and other costly exploits and attacks have made cybersecurity a priority for all manner of public and private organizations. Organizations are increasingly adopting vulnerability disclosure programs (VDPs) as a key strategy for managing and mitigating cybersecurity risk. These programs crowdsource security work?they invite independent security researchers to report newly identified software bugs. Yet, the adoption and management of these programs is rarely simple or straightforward. They can create new points of stress and complication within organization. This project examines how these programs work and, importantly, how they can be improved. Protecting digital networks, devices, and software is a key national priority. Ultimately, the research project?s insights will help organizations improve their security.<br/><br/>While organizations have long relied on a blend of in-house information technology expertise and contracted computer services, VDPs are a different approach to harnessing expertise. This project uncovers the ongoing intra-organizational work required to integrate these new intuitional models of software review within organizations; and it assesses the ultimate effectiveness of VDPs to improve organizational cybersecurity. Specifically, the project addresses two related research questions: (i) What forms of institutional work are needed to create and sustain VDPs?; (ii) How effective are VDPs at improving security? To answer these questions, the project creates and analyzes a novel set of qualitative and quantitative data drawn from select ongoing VDPs. Collected data includes anonymized program data, administrative data, and interviews with staff associated with managing VDPs. This project provides a window into: (i) how new cybersecurity practices are adopted, maintained, and transformed by and within organizations; and (ii) the efficacy of VDPs to improve organizational cybersecurity. Answering these questions will provide insight into larger organizational dimensions of cybersecurity and the efficacy of VDPs to improve security outcomes. More broadly, in addressing these research questions, the project advances insights into the often-overlooked institutional work associated with adopting and sustaining new organizational innovations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to meet this demand and ensure a robust cybersecurity workforce, a more inclusive and diverse workforce is needed. This project aims to address this need and serve the national interest by broadening participation in the NSF?s CyberCorps® Scholarship for Service (SFS) program. Northeastern University?s Center for Inclusive Computing (CIC) will work with SFS institutions to build inclusive environments and increase the representation of students of all races, ethnicities, and genders earning cybersecurity graduate degrees. Specifically, CIC will empower SFS institutions to build bridge programs that connect graduate degree-seeking individuals from populations, who have been historically underrepresented in computing, to advanced degrees in cybersecurity. Such bridge programs will enable the participation of individuals, who may have their undergraduate degrees in subject areas other than computing, to pursue higher education in cybersecurity at SFS project sites. Creating a path for a demographically and socio-economically broader population to access cybersecurity graduate degree programs is critical to strengthening and diversifying the cybersecurity workforce. Over a three-year period, the CIC will work with two cohorts of up to eight SFS institutions (i.e., for a potential total of 16 institutions) to identify and implement strategies that have been shown effective in attracting, retaining, and graduating students who identify as women, Black, African American, Latino(a), Hispanic or Indigenous. <br/><br/>The CIC was created in 2019 as a national effort to increase the representation of women of all races and ethnicities in computing. In addition to supporting institutions financially, the CIC provides program management, technical consulting, data collection, and visualization services. The objectives of this project are to leverage CIC's experience with increasing the participation of women in computing and apply it more broadly to increase the diversity and number of all students participating in SFS projects, with particular attention to those seeking graduate degrees. To achieve these objectives, the CIC will issue a call for proposals to all SFS institutions interested in and committed to building a bridge program. For selected institutions, the project team will conduct in-person site visits involving current students and SFS scholars, cyber faculty, advisors, teaching assistants, and the relevant chair(s), dean(s), or provost(s).

Nearly 70% of U.S. organizations experienced SE in 2017, resulting in a $2.76 million loss in operational downtime and revenues. The human factor is often regarded as the weakest link in cyberattacks, making SE a major concern for cybersecurity. Despite the significant threat posed by SE attacks, education, training and general awareness of SE as a tool for cybercrime is low. This is because SE is considered to be outside the scope of the technical domain and thus should be addressed by other disciplines, including psychology, criminology, and sociology. The engineering and computer science disciplines are already investing heavily in cybersecurity education programs that have a primarily technical focus. While this technical approach is important, the resulting pool of students is too small and homogeneous to support the holistic development of the solutions needed by our technologically dependent society. Enlarging and diversifying the pool of students learning about (and teachers educating on) SE will cast a wider net to recruit the most talented students as well as fostering their creative potential as they enter the cybersecurity workforce. Furthermore, the project will reflect the National Science Foundation?s commitment to broadening participation along two fronts identified in its Strategic Plan: (i) Expanding efforts to broaden participation from underrepresented groups and diverse institutions across all geographical regions, and (ii) Preparing a diverse and engaged STEM workforce. Thus, this project will promote diversity, and develop and share resources and sustainable tools for future SE education and research in a safe, ethical, and engaging learning environment.<br/><br/>This project has three objectives. First, it will educate students via hands-on course projects and a yearly intercollegiate SE Capture the Flag competition and training event. Second, the project will educate educators by hosting online and in-person training workshops across multiple STEM disciplines. Finally, the project will disseminate free resources such as SE course projects, datasets and analytic frameworks for research and education. The project will also develop a new set of assessment tools (surveys and focus groups) with the Center for the Advancement of Teaching to measure student and educator learning specific to SE. This project proposes to enlarge and diversify the pool of students and educators by recruiting across multiple STEM disciplines at community colleges and universities in the U.S. with varying demographics. Minority serving institutions, historically black colleges and universities, and military/veteran friendly schools will be specifically engaged. In addition, the project team will actively seek participation from faculty belonging to underrepresented groups at these institutions. <br/><br/>This project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education. The SaTC program aligns with the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan and the National Privacy Research Strategy to protect and preserve the growing social and economic benefits of cyber systems while ensuring security and privacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Heightened communication and automation are also impacting other industries that involve control of molecular-level processes, as in healthcare, water treatment, and irrigation. However, a challenge for enhanced automation of these processes is preventing cyberattacks on the systems (referred to as control systems) that perform communication and computation to enable automation. If a cyberattack on a control system succeeds, it may impact factors such as safety, profitability, or production volume. Though safety-critical industries have many defenses in place to seek to prevent attackers from causing harm, an open question is how to design stronger safeguards against successful attacks into automation systems. This work aims to develop fundamental advances in advanced control algorithms integrated with algorithms for detecting cyberattacks and alerting company personnel to their presence for chemical processes described by complex dynamic models. This project seeks to characterize the conditions under which the process automation algorithms can be made resilient to cyberattacks on various aspects of the automation systems (e.g., sensors and actuators) in the sense that attacks cannot succeed at creating problematic process behavior from a safety standpoint even if they breach certain information technology defenses. The project will also pursue the development of a number of algorithms for enhancing safety and efficiency for next-generation manufacturing, and explore how cyberattacks may impact these. To disseminate information on these topics broadly,  a live action and an animated short video to be shared via YouTube will be developed, in which the plot and the world in which the characters live expose viewers to the concepts of control, cybersecurity, and engineering pursued in this research through story.<br/><br/>The planned research program will comprehensively evaluate the characteristics of cyberattacks for processes involving molecular-level phenomena of different types, and will develop fundamental advances in control theory and algorithms for enhancing cybersecurity for these processes through control designs integrated with other frameworks such as detection algorithms. The theoretical conditions under which cybersecurity is enhanced by the proposed developments (in the sense that the attacks cannot create a safety issue for the process) will be characterized. Specifically, the following will be addressed: a) a mathematical formalization of the definition of different types of ""undesirable behavior"" for various chemical processes and clarification of reasonable types of cyberattacks for different chemical process systems will be developed; b) control and state estimation designs will be combined with detection techniques to allow guarantees to be developed on the conditions under which a cyberattack cannot create undesirable behavior even if it penetrates certain information technology defenses; c) novel sensing and control capabilities for cyber-physical systems will be developed that take advantage of machine learning and mathematics to increase flexibility of chemical processes, with investigations of how these advances may be cyberattacked; d) techniques for understanding and preventing undesirable behavior during a cyberattack through physical means (e.g., materials/equipment design and selection) will be developed; and e) the developments will be demonstrated and evaluated within the context of chemical processes across a variety of industries. These developments will focus on processes described by nonlinear dynamic models under model predictive control, but will also make extensions to processes of other types (e.g., a class of stochastic differential equations or partial differential equations).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, traditional methods for discovering and optimizing AMPs are inefficient, costly, and technically demanding. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and bioinformatics has revolutionized this process, but the reliance on large, often unverified datasets introduces significant cybersecurity risks. Manipulated or erroneous data can lead to costly and time-consuming setbacks. This project develops an automated framework for the security assessment of training data in bioinformatics, particularly focusing on AMPs. The framework evaluates both the sequence and functionality of AMPs, considering the costs associated with laboratory validation experiments. This effort enhances the reliability of computational predictions, reduces the need for costly wet-lab validations, and fosters a culture of security-mindedness within the scientific community. Additionally, it creates an open-source dataset focused on AMPs functionality security and an online platform for dataset evaluation and security education.<br/><br/>The project has two key tasks: 1) model-driven low-quality data filtering and 2) data poisoning vulnerability exploration and defenses. By developing a novel graph model for analyzing AMPs structures and compiling an open-source dataset for AI training, this project automates security assessments, significantly enhancing data integrity and security against both inadvertent and malicious data vulnerabilities. This research advances bioinformatics by providing robust cybersecurity tools for AMPs research and other peptide/protein research, bridging gaps in data security, and fostering safer, more reliable scientific collaborations.

We include a contingency plan for possible travel restrictions. The overarching theme of students' research projects is to enable a massively inverter-based electric power system while addressing their control, communication, and cybersecurity requirements and challenges. As the power system transitions to include a larger share of renewables and inverter-based generation, it challenges conventional stability and control concepts. Simultaneously, the electric power grid's growing dependency on information and communication technology (ICT) significantly increases its vulnerability to network unavailability and security issues. Therefore, ensuring timely and secure delivery of data is central to guaranteeing the performance of control, optimization, and supervisory systems. This work is expected to contribute to (i) algorithms to study the feasibility of interconnection of renewables to the power system, (ii) control and design of power systems, microgrids, and inverters in 100% renewables setting, and (iii) inverter and microgrid cybersecurity under communication-enabled strategies. This is an area in which the U.S. PIs and French collaborators have complementary expertise. Under Grenoble mentorship, the U.S. students work on these research challenges. Students' exposure to these problems, especially in a European context, is expected to help them think of innovative solutions to the similar challenges in the United States.

However, drones are frequently witnessed misbehaving by flying over private properties, restricted areas, and cyber-critical infrastructures, collecting privacy- and security-sensitive information illegally. Thus, the project team is building a Cyber-Aerial Computing curriculum to expose undergraduate engineering students to drone technology and potential drone-centric cyber and privacy threats and attacks, developing their domain knowledge, ethics, and hands-on experience. The project examines the use of Socio-Scientific Inquiry (SSI) and Flipped Learning (FL) frameworks in developing the cybersecurity workforce's ability to engage in ethically informed practices with an advanced understanding of drone technology mechanisms for various personal and societal purposes. A framework for teaching cybersecurity and privacy from multiple perspectives will also be provided to other engineering disciplines to educate their students.<br/><br/>The project goal focuses on developing a new research-based curriculum for undergraduate engineering students to engage in an ethical exploration of drone-centric cybersecurity and privacy. First, the curriculum features an innovative drone-based research paradigm that leverages drones for users to protect against privacy invasion and information leakage using personal drones. Second, the project team uses design-based research to improve the curriculum's quality based on the SSI and FL frameworks and promote students' content mastery, higher-order thinking, and ethical decision-making. Third, the curriculum has four major learning modules with SSI-based driving questions. Each module spans four weeks with the same instructional system using SSI activities and hands-on practices to ensure this intervention performs as intended. Finally, formative and summative assessments engage students in authentic tasks and ethics discussions. The project will contribute to improving Sky-of-Privacy-Things education and the growth of the cybersecurity workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Indeed, in 2018, McAfee estimated that the global economic damages caused by cybercrime was 600 billion USD, with as many as 2/3rds of all Internet users having been affected by personal data breaches. Moreover, many of these breaches were the result of human error. Prior work in usable privacy and security has identified three barriers that help explain why pro-S&P behaviors remain rare: awareness, motivation and ability. The overarching hypothesis  of  this  proposal  is  that  it should  be  possible  to  address  these  barriers  to  pro-S&P  behaviors  by creating  corporeal security and privacy interfaces (CSPIs)  that allow  people  to  take  advantage  of  their  corporeal  threat  perception  (e.g., intuitively understanding that walking in a dimly lit area is less safe than walking in a well-lit area) and their natural understanding of the physics-based affordances of the physical world (e.g., whispering to reduce the range of who can hear one?s voice) in digital S&P-relevant contexts. To test this hypothesis, this project proposes to design, implement and evaluate three novel CSPIs.  First, Bit Whisperer is a wireless communication protocol that situates digital communications on physical surfaces to raise people?s awareness of the audience of and threats to their wireless communications.  Second, Spidey Sense is a smartwatch wristband that delivers affective haptic feedback to motivate heightened responses to S&P warnings.  Third, Horcrux is a tangible smart mat that improves people?s ability to collaboratively author access control policies for collectively owned and shared digital resources. This research, if successful, could significantly improve the widespread adoption of pro-S&P behaviors and, in turn, mitigate vulnerabilities that result from human error.<br/><br/>This proposal marries ideas from tangible, wearable, and haptic computing with challenges in end-user cybersecurity and privacy. The proposed work will encompass some of the first attempts to integrate state-of-the-art tangible interaction techniques designed to address the awareness, ability and motivation barriers to pro-S&P behaviors, by asking research questions such as: (a) How might situated digital communications improve people?s awareness of the range of their wireless communications and the threats thereof? (b) How might affective haptics improve end-users? motivation to respond to S&P warnings? (c) How might tangible user interfaces improve the ability of social groups to collaboratively author access control policies for shared accounts and resources? In exploring these questions, the research will make the following high-level intellectual contributions: (i) the iterative design and implementation of three CSPIs---Bit Whisperer, Spidey Sense and Horcrux; (ii) rigorous empirical studies in which we will explore the effectiveness of these CSPIs in addressing the awareness, motivation and ability barriers to pro-S&P behaviors; and (iii) a synthesized set of design opportunities and challenges for CSPIs in the context of usable S&P. The outputs of this project will serve as a foundation for a new cross-disciplinary collaboration between scholars in the HCI, S&P and Tangible Computing communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This generated a critical need for developing educational practices that prepare the current and future workforce to investigate cyber threats and process digital evidence. Strategies to achieve effective balance of theoretical and practical education are yet to be fully determined. To address the need for effective and balanced educational practices, this project will introduce active-learning pedagogy into an existing computer forensics curriculum. Its effect will then be measured based on student success and development of industry-relevant skills. Measurement will be accomplished in three ways. First, through evaluating the appropriate balance, and ordering, of forensic, computer science, and criminal justice courses needed to develop a strong theoretical understanding. Second, through introducing classroom training with hardware and software currently used within the discipline, to develop strong practical skills for entry-level positions. Third, through providing hands-on internships that require processing of digital evidence from active criminal investigations to provide work experience and job training. As San Jose State University is both a Hispanic-Serving Institution and an Asian American and Pacific Islander-Serving Institution, a focus will be placed on how these curricular changes contribute to the diversification of the cybersecurity workforce.<br/> <br/>Computer forensic (CF) investigators require a unique education balancing forensics, computer science, and criminal justice. This includes not only a theoretical foundation, but also practical experience processing digital evidence. To meet these needs, education will incorporate training on the technologies and current best practices used within the discipline through hands-on experiences with the latest trends in sources (devices) of digital evidence. Existing learning environments will be modified in three different ways and evaluated to measure the impacts on student success and workplace preparedness, especially among underrepresented groups. First, by identifying how students? navigational path (e.g., order of courses, pre-existing knowledge) within the interdisciplinary coursework impacts the successful completion of the program, and how modifications to these pathways can increase student success. Second, by introducing active-learning pedagogy into the classroom and training on hardware and software currently used by CF practitioners. Third, by developing a laboratory infrastructure for students to complete internships where they can conduct digital evidence investigations on active criminal cases. <br/> <br/>The effectiveness of these modifications will be measured through interviews with CF practitioners on the skill sets required for the discipline, surveys of student navigation and activities, surveys of laboratory intern experiences, and surveys of graduates' abilities to successfully transition into careers within the discipline. Results will be disseminated through online open-source educational materials, presentations to criminal justice agencies and higher education institutions, and peer-reviewed publications. Dissemination of results will aid the development of effective CF curriculum at other institutions. <br/> <br/>This project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education.

In order to enable heterogeneous drones to autonomously connect with the existing Internet architecture, the Internet of Drones (IoD) paradigm has been created to generate a network of interconnections among drones as well as zone service providers. As the IoD paradigm has been widely adopted in various civilian and military application domains, the IoD systems are being targeted by adversaries to cause damage to properties, people, and cyberspace. This project seeks to develop a security mechanism which is applicable and suitable for multi-tasking and large-scale IoD applications with strong privacy preservation. The proposed security mechanism can be easily integrated with the existing IoD paradigm and enable IoD systems to achieve the desired levels of security and privacy while meeting the practical requirements of IoD applications. These outcomes are expected to have a positive impact on the construction of secure and efficient aerial communication framework in the future. Currently, seniors have limited cybersecurity awareness, and women and Native Americans remain underrepresented in cybersecurity education/workforce. The effort also includes a novel effort to increase seniors? cybersecurity awareness, and several outreach activities for broadening participation in computing and cybersecurity.<br/><br/>The overall objective of this project is to develop a novel certificate-based authentication scheme that enables pseudonymous, application-aware, and cross-domain IoD communications. To attain the overall objective, this project will design a certificate issuing protocol, create a certificate conversion protocol, and produce a certificate revocation protocol. The proposed certificate-based authentication scheme advances the state of the art by supporting multi-tasking and large-scale IoD applications with strong privacy preservation. The proposed scheme will be evaluated via security analysis and verification, event-driven network simulation, and real-world experiments.

These objectives are grouped around five main modules designed to cover a wide space of security and privacy concerns around AI models: Fundamentals and Threats; Adversarial Attacks and Robustness; Privacy, Ethics, and Trust; Secure Development and Data Governance; and Case Studies. Each module will be covered in two to three two-hour workshop sessions. Each workshop starts with one hour of a webinar or a panel of experts debating or discussing the workshop's key topics, followed by one hour of experiential learning component. That second component will consist of either a demo using real-world examples or a hands-on activity asking participants to complete a lab activity, which builds on the materials covered in the first hour. Participants will then present a demonstration of their lab work to other participants or write a reflection on what they learned. The project team will run the workshop series three times, with an evaluation and iteration cycle after each series to improve the materials. Together, the work will lead to a better understanding of both building more trustworthy AI-based systems and how to incorporate security, privacy, and ethics training as part of technical curricula.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the brain is constantly receiving and ignoring massive volumes of sensory signals yet remains perpetually vigilant to anomalies in order to respond rapidly to unanticipated inputs. In contrast, modern AI performs poorly on similar tasks, requiring extensive training and propagation through multi-layer artificial neural networks. Consequently, robust anomaly detection in AI is slow and energy inefficient, posing challenges for high-value applications such as cybersecurity. Neuroscience research has shown that the cerebellum allows anomaly detection to emerge through contextual prediction, pattern separation, and response actuation. In an effort to emulate cerebellar functions, this project develops electronic devices that switch between asynchronous and synchronous behavior when triggered by sensory inputs. These devices are derived from nanoelectronics materials that realize temporally coherent signaling for diverse applications including cybersecurity, autonomous robotics, and power-delivery control. In addition, this project comprehensively analyzes the ethical, legal, and societal implications of the proposed research in collaboration with multiple stakeholders including college students, educators, and community workers. To ensure that these transformative outcomes are communicated to the most diverse audiences, multiple education and outreach initiatives aim to broaden participation among underrepresented and marginalized sections of society.<br/><br/>Neuromorphic hardware chips are emerging as disruptive technologies to process and categorize vast amounts of digital data. The majority of the current implementations are based on well-studied feed-forward and recurrent neuronal architectures of the mammalian cerebrum and are thus optimized to perform only certain types of classification tasks. In contrast, theoretical neuroscience concepts derived from the cerebellum are underrepresented in artificial intelligence hardware even though the cerebellum has evolved to efficiently solve a wide range of problems such as anomaly detection in complex and noisy environments. Cerebellar accuracy and robustness are achieved by a unique neuronal coding architecture based on high firing rates, temporally coherent signaling, and complex spiking. To achieve similar functionality, this project develops electronic hardware that emulates the essential features of cerebellar neuronal coding. The resulting bio-realistic implementations are tested against the use cases of anomaly detection in cybersecurity, autonomous robotics, and power-delivery control. Specifically, this cross-disciplinary project combines ideas from theoretical neuroscience, materials science, and computer engineering to develop hardware prototypes based on two-dimensional semiconductors and van der Waals heterojunctions including synaptic devices based on memtransistors and spiking neurons based on Gaussian heterojunction transistors. In addition, this project comprehensively analyzes the ethical, legal, and societal implications of the proposed research in collaboration with multiple stakeholders including college students, educators, and community workers.

Today?s computer networks have grown both in complexity and in scale, in part as a response to diverse connectivity requirements in the era of the Internet of Things, Cloud 3.0, and Big Data. Existing network management solutions cannot keep up with the demand for solutions to real-time network management problems resulting from these increasingly complex networks. Network management requires a fundamentally new approach in which networks can autonomously control, configure, and manage themselves. While these ?self-driving networks? offer numerous opportunities for efficient network management, they introduce new threats and attack vectors that must be addressed to secure them. Unfortunately, there is currently a shortfall of professionals trained in autonomous and intelligent network security and a shortfall of content with which to train these professionals. This project will address these shortfalls by developing lab-intensive modules that enable undergraduate students to gain fundamental and advanced knowledge in securing next-generation self-driving networks. <br/><br/>The project team will develop six self-contained modules with comprehensive coverage of the techniques, tools, and methods required to secure self-driving networks. The modules will cover (1) attack investigation and analysis of legacy, Software Defined Networking (SDN), and adversarial attacks; (2) hunting for vulnerabilities using static analysis, software component analysis, automated known attack patterns, and behavioral analysis; (3) network-wide data collection using classic and OpenFlow based approaches; (4) protection using runtime application self-protection, automated patching, and security information and event management; (5) evaluation using continuous adaptive risk and thrust assessment; and (6) action using security orchestration, automation and response. In addition, this project aims to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM by organizing workshops and participating in professional conferences. The project team will also organize a workshop to disseminate the modules to interested faculty members from other organizations.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education.

However, real-world servers are plagued by various security vulnerabilities. Memory overwrite and over-read vulnerabilities are among the most dangerous of the known vulnerabilities. They are the root causes for a variety of serious real-world server attacks. Cyber-defenses are broadly deployed to protect real-world servers from these cyberattacks. However, it is widely recognized in the cybersecurity community that there is no silver bullet. Moreover, the existing cyber-defenses (e.g. patching) are still very limited in handling the so-called zero-day vulnerabilities. Furthermore, a fundamental limitation is that the widely deployed real-world defenses usually do not provide provable guarantees. This project aims to develop online learning-based adaptive cyber defenses, which are expected to be able to provide provable guarantees for real-world servers. The developed defenses will present adversaries with optimized dynamically changing attack surfaces, thereby significantly increasing uncertainty and complexity that adversaries would need to overcome in order to succeed. These measures are expected to substantially improve adaptive and autonomous defense capabilities of real-world servers against zero-day attacks.<br/><br/>This project will develop a new co-design framework to protect data centers against (i) stochastic attacks through dynamic runtime environments; (ii) intelligent strategic attacks through dynamic platforms; and (iii) multi-stage attacks through dynamic networks. The co-design framework will involve three intertwined components: newly synthesized mathematical models, online learning-based defense algorithms and server retrofitting. In particular, the mathematical models will be of high-fidelity and also analytically tractable to allow online learning to provide provable guarantees. On the other hand, the deviations of the mathematical models from real-world servers will be bridged by server retrofitting. In each proposed mathematical model, a utility function can be easily evaluated by deployed preliminary defenses and will provide necessary feedback to perform online learning, and on the other hand, it properly reflects the cost-effectiveness of defenses. Online learning algorithms are developed to tackle the unique challenges of computer security (e.g., detection delays, detection inaccuracies, strategic attacks, unknown system states and unknown exploit likelihoods). The most suitable server retrofitting will be customized to meet the assumptions of the mathematical models. Further, the three intertwined components will be integrated into real defenses. The proposed research is interdisciplinary and integrates technical tools from machine learning, game theory, control theory and cybersecurity. Hackathon events will be held to inspire students? engagement in research on machine learning and cybersecurity. All the research results will be made available to industrial stakeholders, federal government agencies and the research community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increasingly, many firms seek to integrate cyber threat intelligence (CTI) about emerging threats and their relevance to vulnerabilities within their assets. However, much of the current CTI analyst practice is reactive, in which analysis manually examines exploits (software that circumvents vulnerabilities and allows an attacker to manipulate cyber-assets) after an attack. More proactive approaches to using CTI might prevent many cyber-attacks; in particular, sources such as Dark Web hacker forums often include signals about possible emerging exploit trends and attack vectors. However, these large, international, and ever-evolving platforms often contain millions of posts, a scale that makes conventional CTI analysis prohibitive, limited, error-prone, and time-consuming. Therefore, this project seeks to develop Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled analytics techniques based on text analysis and network science to identify emerging trends and to link exploits to vulnerabilities. The models and results produced from this research will be integrated into curricula for cybersecurity students and data scientists to help rapidly grow a well-trained workforce in proactive AI-enabled CTI analytics. <br/><br/>This CAREER project seeks to develop two thrusts of proactive CTI research. The first is a novel Diachronic Graph Transformer (DGT) to detect and predict emerging exploit terms, semantics, and trends through advancing methods for balancing word embedding stability and capturing their shifts   over time.  The second is a self-supervised neural information retrieval method, entitled the Exploit-Vulnerability Self-Supervised Linker, that links hacker exploits to vulnerabilities in a manner consistent with CTI analysts' procedures and that accounts for a technology's configurations, dependencies, and other characteristics. The data and methods from this research will be integrated into three thrusts to improve cyber-AI education: (1) new lessons for an AI for Cybersecurity course at Indiana University, (2) resources to enhance the cybersecurity curricula of NSF CyberCorps Scholarship-for-Service institutions, and (3) proactive CTI learning modules for the AI+ platform offered by the Open Data Science Conference, one of the world's largest data science communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project?s broader significance is in integrating insights of human behavior into cybersecurity tools, leading to better protection of vulnerable subpopulations and greater inclusiveness in cybersecurity. <br/> <br/>This project pursues two goals. First, it develops an eye-tracking study to discover variations in attention patterns observable across populations with and without developmental disabilities when exposed to scams and legitimate social media posts. Second, it uses observed variations in attention patterns to highlight representation biases in the labeled datasets of NLP-based scam detection models. It further creates a novel set of linguistic attributes that can be used to train scam detection models tailored to aid vulnerable subpopulations. Project outcomes include a better understanding of social media scams for vulnerable subpopulations, the development of an inclusive NLP model for scam detection, and an open-source browser plugin prototype to aid individuals with developmental disabilities via tailored scam alerts.

For the first time, many instructors were faced with the dilemma of how to administer exams, quizzes effectively, and other in-class assignments in an online setting in which live, in-person proctoring was not available. Online proctoring quickly became an attractive option to monitor students remotely while completing an assignment. In response to this increasing shift towards learning (and testing) from home, this project will examine the security and privacy implications of remote proctoring services as they pertain to school policies and educational practices. This multi-pronged research program will examine how these services impact students, educators, and institutions' security and privacy. The research program is inspired by the widespread adoption of remote proctoring services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the findings will be more broadly applicable as institutions will likely continue to offer virtual classes and online technology services to support those classes.<br/><br/>The research activities are multidisciplinary and will advance knowledge in pedagogy as well as address vulnerabilities that stem from human behaviors and choices in security and privacy. Online proctoring technology requires extensive monitoring capabilities to work properly; these include systems for observing behavior (e.g., screen capture and video/audio recording) and restricting behavior (e.g., lock-down browsing and the installation of network firewall rules). In combination, these monitoring and restricting functionalities impose privacy and security risks on the students who are completing assignments in this setting. The research activities will directly address how students, educators, and institutions understand this exposure and its impact. Additionally, the project will identify the kinds of monitoring and restrictions that are effective and necessary.

However, there is a critical shortage of EV and CAV technicians, especially in the non-original equipment manufacturer (OEM), suppliers, and automotive shops. The workforce need will be detrimental to the industry without interventions to increase the applicant pool and retain employees. This project will leverage the EV certificate program previously developed by the NSF-ATE, Resource Center for Advanced Automotive Technology (RCAAT) to respond to the industry needs. Curricula will be adapted based on an annual review with the Michigan EV Jobs Academy, Employer-Led Collaborative (ELC) so that program changes align with the pace and transition of industry. The project will target underemployed adults and secondary students, in addition to women and minorities who are currently underrepresented in the advanced automotive industry. The project will also provide early exposure to careers for secondary students and expand relationships with four-year universities to develop clear career pathways allowing students to advance their education and careers.<br/><br/>This project will establish a new associate degree program in EV technology, upgrade the current EV certificate program, and develop two new certificate programs in CAV and cybersecurity. The project creates a co-leadership model that requires administrators, faculty, industry, and educational partners to co-develop curricula that meets workplace standards. It will also break down traditional academic silos by requiring faculty from different disciplines (engineering and automotive technology, and business and information technology) to work together. This is crucial because cybersecurity and CAV technologies are increasingly being integrated into new EVs. It is also important as educational institutions shift from engineering technician education that is mechanically based to a curriculum that is software and computer and power electronics based. The project will collaborate with educators at high schools, industry, and universities to develop clearly defined technician career pathways to advanced education. The project will also develop and implement early exposure activities for high school students, introducing them to careers in the advanced automotive industry. The certificate programs in CAV and cybersecurity will be offered in a compressed short course format for on-demand workforce\technician education that will lead students quickly into sustainable wage employment. Pathways to advancement that allow existing workers to upskill at a rapid pace will also be available. Additionally, the curriculum will be shared and available via the hybrid/virtual delivery Educational Programs in Collaboration (EPiC) consortium platform through the Michigan Association of Community Colleges, which will provide convenience and flexibility for learners. The EPiC Consortium provides the ability to scale up training with potential talent pools throughout the state. In the long-term, the project will lead to a better prepared workforce that is more gender and racially diverse to address the technician skills gap leading to greater economic impact for the region.

A number of vendors nowadays provide cloud-based access to physical quantum computers for researchers to design, implement, and optimize quantum algorithms. However, with prevailing malicious attacks to cyber infrastructure, this cloud-based quantum-classical model introduces significant security and privacy concerns to quantum computing systems. It becomes imperative to cultivate skilled cybersecurity professionals with expertise in quantum computing. However, this is challenging due to the lack of educational material that integrates both quantum computing and cybersecurity and privacy subjects. This project fills this gap by developing a comprehensive set of curricular modules and an experiential learning platform with hands-on labs to support quantum computing systems security and privacy (QuanSP) education and workforce development at scale.<br/><br/>The project team is developing hands-on labs and curricular modules for integrated multidisciplinary quantum computing and cybersecurity education. It allows students to learn two traditionally disconnected subjects with experimentation labs and engaging curricular modules. These materials incorporate socio-technical aspects of QuanSP to provide a holistic understanding of the subject matter. The learning-by-seeing-and-doing experience offered by the visualization-driven lab platform fosters systematic thinking of learners on quantum computing security and privacy. The project further provides hands-on opportunities to implement and create sophisticated security- and privacy-by-deign strategies to counteract adversarial threats targeting different layers in the cloud-based quantum computing ecosystem. The project team is integrating the developments into curricula at different levels and disseminating the outcomes to the broader community in the field through outreach activities to advance QuanSP research and education.

Filters are extensively used to compactly represent large datasets in fast memory (RAM) and avoid unnecessary I/Os across databases, storage systems, computational biology, cybersecurity, and networks. Yet modern data-intensive applications are severely bottlenecked by the limitations in filters. A fundamental limitation of traditional filters is that they do not change their representation upon seeing a false positive match. Therefore, the maximum false positive rate is only guaranteed for a single query, not a stream of queries. If users can adapt after seeing false positive matches, they can improve the filter performance for a stream of queries (especially skewed distributions). This project focuses on two goals. First, to design a high-performance, space-efficient, and practical adaptive filter with strong adaptivity guarantees, which means that the performance and false-positive probability guarantees continue to hold even for adversarial workloads. Second, to do a deep dive into various performance trade-offs in applications and integrate the adaptive filter in databases, cybersecurity applications, and computational biology tools. The effort redesigns existing applications and develops new software tools to establish appropriate trade-offs and achieve high performance and space efficiency. <br/><br/>This project has the following top-level approach: develop the theory and an accompanying data structure library for strong adaptive filters under various real-world workloads involving deletions and updates, resizing, and merging two adaptive filters.  It demonstrates the impact of adaptive filters in the real world by integrating the adaptive filter into applications and achieving massive speed-ups and robust performance for skewed and adversarial workloads. This project will enhance the capability of applications across databases, computational biology, and cybersecurity to achieve higher and stronger performance guarantees. Both accelerated computation (allowing quicker feedback and more experiments) and more extensive computation potentially accelerate the process of scientific discovery. Furthermore, this project places a strong emphasis on combining theory and practice. In addition, the research team will also develop teaching material on adaptive data structures and their usage in modern data-intensive applications and make it freely available online.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to develop a learner-centered co-pilot tool leveraging advances in artificial intelligence (AI) to produce attack scenarios and capture related data, which includes end-to-end attack interactions between the red team attacker and the cyber systems.  The resulting high-quality and structured attack artifact repository will be a highly valuable resource to the cyber security research community, especially for the test and validation of security solutions. <br/><br/>This project adopts large language model (LLM) to help cybersecurity research. Through an LLM adaptation approach, the red-team co-pilot will incorporate techniques such as prompt engineering, reasoning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and few-shot learning to guide users to emulate attack scenarios. The project will develop a curator-friendly methodology to enable the crowd-sourced aggregation of high-quality cyberattack artifacts associated with attack behaviors and system settings, when the tool is deployed in the research community.  The captured dataset contains both functional and behavioral aspects of attacks such as tactics, techniques, and procedures. A successful research outcome, including the tools generated, can help facilitate security benchmarking, AI-based penetration testing, adversarial modeling, and research reproducibility.

Solving tomorrow?s cyberattacks on connected vehicles requires today?s students to learn in multidisciplinary teams about the evolving cyber threats and think broadly about detecting such attacks, which will change daily. This project?s vision is to transform programs at Benedict College using an integrated and scalable approach to produce students capable of innovating in non-traditional, interdisciplinary teams to solve the unique cybersecurity problems. It develops and evaluates detection models, focusing on cyberattacks in the in-vehicle systems and the wireless network connecting the vehicles with other vehicles, infrastructure, and services. <br/><br/>The transportation cyber-physical systems consist of mobile edges (e.g., connected vehicles), fixed edge devices, backend servers, and in-vehicle systems, which run different safety, mobility, and environmental applications. Due to the application requirements, the edge devices exchange real-time, heterogeneous data with each other and with the backend servers through different communication options. Attacks on connected vehicles applications can have a significant impact on public safety. For example, once the malware is injected, a critical safety application, such as the collision warning, can malfunction and result in catastrophic consequences. Detecting cybersecurity threats in real-time is challenging because of the dynamic behavior of such attacks, especially in a connected vehicle environment where the vehicles and pedestrians are in motion. To address these, change-point models can potentially detect anomalies in real-time. Also, data-driven artificial intelligence-based models can detect these attacks as these models are adaptable to different attack types with known and unknown patterns. The project tasks include the development and comparison of efficacies of the real-time cyberattack detection strategies, which are based on change-point and artificial intelligence models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to be proficient in these areas, one must draw from a broad set of disciplines. Effective training in such interdisciplinary emerging areas poses several structural and pedagogical challenges. The limited availability of educational resources in these areas often requires educators to collect and curate materials from several sources. Manually developing courses and identifying relevant student learning objectives (SLOs) can be a considerable burden for educators. In addition, learning from courses created this way can be challenging for students. Traditional approaches are not adequate for teaching interdisciplinary areas, since they do not provide the hands-on learning experiences needed to study interactions among disciplines. This project will address the above challenges by developing and disseminating a state-of-the-art experiential learning-based platform, QUINTET: Quantum internet education and training synthesizer. <br/><br/>The QUINTET platform will include: (1) Eight course modules on classical and quantum networking, networking algorithms, quantum internet components and quantum routing, classical and quantum cryptography, and classical and quantum network security; (2) A Learning Objects Repository (LOR) consisting of learning objects that meet SLOs, including modular interactive widgets, relevant text, videos, exercises, and quizzes and tests to synthesize lessons; (3) Use of Kolb?s four phases of experiential learning, including hands-on, virtual quantum network experimentation and universal design for learning, which offers multiple equivalent representations of the same concept for inclusive and accessible learning; (4) New assessment methodology that uses data collection embedded within lesson plans and qualitative assessments that allow instructors and learners to review their performance through reflection zones and active experimentation; and (5) A design in alignment with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Inter-operable, and Reusable) principles and instrumented with a rich set of metadata that allows efficient retrieval and customization of course modules for a variety of learning experiences.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education.

In a typical scenario, a malicious individual installs software on a victim's mobile device that tracks the device's location, enabling remote monitoring of its activity. This is not a hypothetical threat: there are reports of intimate partner abusers installing spyware on their victims' smartphones and of journalists, political dissidents, and human rights activists being similarly targeted by repressive regimes. Traditional defenses such as antivirus software are unable to fully counter this threat. While antivirus software may be able to flag and remove surveillanceware, some victims are unable to uninstall surveillanceware because of coercion such as threats of physical violence. This project seeks to systematically study surveillanceware and develop new artificial intelligence (AI)-based defenses for it. In doing so, the project helps broaden cybersecurity research to include the concerns of vulnerable individuals and groups (e.g., survivors of intimate partner violence) whose cybersecurity needs have often historically been neglected. To pursue the project, the investigators plan to assemble a diverse team and collaborate with local organizations (e.g., domestic abuse shelters) and international partners (e.g., the Coalition Against Stalkerware).<br/><br/>The focus of this research effort is the design of methods and tools to mitigate the threat of surveillanceware, and in particular, developing a deception-based system that uses machine learning techniques and system security mechanisms to produce fake but plausible (""synthetic"") data to be fed to the monitoring apparatus of surveillanceware instead of the real data. The research is naturally organized into three thrusts, starting with a comprehensive analysis of surveillanceware and its capabilities for the purpose of adversarial modeling. The second thrust builds on this analysis to develop techniques to create fake but plausible data that can be used as decoy. This requires the use of machine learning techniques, specifically deep generative models. The final thrust involves designing system mechanisms that can be combined with the machinery developed in the previous thrust to ensure the integrity of the defense. In so doing, the project will move forward an understanding of formal adversarial models for surveillanceware, techniques for synthesizing plausible data and deniable data embedding, and system-level mechanisms that integrate with machine learning techniques to thwart surveillance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlike secure coding skills or a security mindset, TP provides the foundational knowledge necessary to teach and learn about these related concepts effectively. Current studies indicate that undergraduate computer science (CS) students in the U.S. often graduate without formal software security education and struggle to develop a security mindset while developing and managing software applications. Even when basic security attacks are taught, students tend to view them as a checklist rather than understanding their real-world implications. Research in the learning sciences shows that merely working through a checklist does not lead to a deeper understanding of how different threats emerge in the real world. This project addresses this gap by formalizing TP based on learning theory, developing methods to measure and assess TP, and designing educational interventions to improve TP learning among undergraduate CS students. By advancing TP education, this project supports the national interest by promoting the progress of science and securing national defense through better-prepared software developers.<br/><br/>The project's primary goal is to formalize the concept of threat perception (TP) in software development, measure and assess students' TP, and design interventions to improve TP among undergraduate computer science (CS) students. The scope includes developing a mechanistic model of TP based on constructivist learning theory, analyzing how different code analysis tasks, such as ""Build It, Break It, Fix It"" (BiBiFi), affect students' TP, and creating a curricular unit that teaches TP through BiBiFi-style projects. The methods involve systematic analysis of students' learning processes and designing educational tools that can be integrated seamlessly into existing courses. This project aims to produce a comprehensive understanding of how students learn and apply TP in software development, providing valuable insights for educators and contributing to the development of more secure software systems. By demystifying the process of identifying and addressing security threats, this project will broaden participation in computer security education to all undergraduate CS students rather than a self-selected group of security-focused students.

Previous work has shown that only a fraction of cyber abuse victims adopt self-protective behaviors. This may occur because some victims lack the background knowledge required to identify cyber abuse and to assert appropriate protective behaviors. While education can be effective in this regard, classroom delivery may fail to reproduce the diverse and dynamic context of cyber abuse, making it difficult for students to effectively translate knowledge into practice. This project seeks to increase the adoption of self-protective behaviors by integrating educational content into social networking interactions. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques will be used to optimize the placement and timing of educational content. The project has the potential to improve the security and privacy of vulnerable social network users.<br/><br/>The project team will leverage their expertise in cybersecurity, AI, and education to investigate, develop and evaluate a new educational framework that provides just-in-time awareness training to identify and respond appropriately to cyber abuse when using social networks. First, the team will develop AI-based solutions to detect and classify cyber abuse based on abuse traces in the accounts of the users involved. The team will also leverage data and feedback collected from study participants to build a ground-truth dataset of instances and timelines of cyber abuse. Second, the team will design and implement targeted learning content and user interface nudges to deliver the knowledge required to make safer decisions in social network interactions. Third, the team will develop AI-based techniques to determine the ideal placement of learning content that improves user adoption of self-protective behaviors.

Cybersecurity plays a ubiquitous role in our daily lives. Cryptography and coding theory provide the most essential blocks to secure our cyberspace. Cryptography ensures confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of data, while coding theory contributes to the availability of data in case of transmission errors or unavailability of servers. Both areas address critical national security issues. The cybersecurity job market is currently experiencing a shortage of qualified personal, especially in the fields of cryptography and coding theory, which require significant technical training. Meanwhile, cryptography and coding theory are also active areas of research at the interface of computer science, mathematics, and physics. The breadth of skills required to perform successful independent research on these topics makes some of the most promising research angles very challenging to approach for new graduate students. For each of three summers, this REU Site offers 10 undergraduate students the opportunity to perform research for 10 weeks in cryptography and coding theory under the mentorship of an interdisciplinary team of senior personal with expertise in mathematics, quantum computing, applied cryptography and hardware security.  Additionally, this REU aims to mitigate the gender gap and the diversity gap in cybersecurity by focusing its recruitment effort on women and under-represented communities. <br/> <br/>This REU Site focuses on some of the most active and interdisciplinary areas of research in cryptography and coding theory. In particular, students are given the opportunity to explore different angles of post-quantum cryptography, which consists in the design of cryptosystems that will resist attacks from future quantum computers. Research projects available to the students include the design and analysis of cryptosystems based on Euclidean lattices, on error-correcting codes, as well as the technical aspects pertaining to their practical deployment. Students are also given the opportunity to explore the mathematical aspects of block cipher design through projects on Almost Perfect non-Linear (APN) functions, as well as the design of error correcting codes that optimize the redundancy effort to mitigate the impact of the unavailability of servers. This REU Site also offers participants opportunities for personal development such as training in cryptography and coding theory by an interdisciplinary team of senior personnel, and professional workshops on intellectual property and graduate school applications. In addition, participants take part in an REU Site research symposium at the end of the summer that brings together REU Site participants from all disciplines across the University of South Florida. <br/><br/>This site is jointly funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF Directorate of Computer and Information Science and Engineering and the Division of Mathematical Sciences REU programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For the first time, many instructors were faced with the dilemma of how to administer exams, quizzes effectively, and other in-class assignments in an online setting in which live, in-person proctoring was not available. Online proctoring quickly became an attractive option to monitor students remotely while completing an assignment. In response to this increasing shift towards learning (and testing) from home, this project will examine the security and privacy implications of remote proctoring services as they pertain to school policies and educational practices. This multi-pronged research program will examine how these services impact students, educators, and institutions' security and privacy. The research program is inspired by the widespread adoption of remote proctoring services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the findings will be more broadly applicable as institutions will likely continue to offer virtual classes and online technology services to support those classes.<br/><br/>The research activities are multidisciplinary and will advance knowledge in pedagogy as well as address vulnerabilities that stem from human behaviors and choices in security and privacy. Online proctoring technology requires extensive monitoring capabilities to work properly; these include systems for observing behavior (e.g., screen capture and video/audio recording) and restricting behavior (e.g., lock-down browsing and the installation of network firewall rules). In combination, these monitoring and restricting functionalities impose privacy and security risks on the students who are completing assignments in this setting. The research activities will directly address how students, educators, and institutions understand this exposure and its impact. Additionally, the project will identify the kinds of monitoring and restrictions that are effective and necessary. The research activities and findings will also contribute to fundamental research in usable security/privacy and educational research that considers the pedagogy and efficacy of online proctoring tools.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education.

Organizations usually deploy SOCs to manage their network operations, defend against threats in the cyber space, and maintain regulatory compliance. Automation and metrics play key roles in the effectiveness of SOC environments. Unfortunately, security-driven automation in SOCs is often implemented in ad-hoc ways and is not accurately reflected in the metrics. Even though SOC environments are dealing with constantly changing threats, IT systems on their enterprise networks and SOC procedures are fairly static. Current SOC metrics tend to focus on straight-forward quantitative measurements (e.g., number of closed tickets) while the role of human analysts in the automation process is not accurately assessed. This project's novelties include the creation of a SOC framework that enables tailored security-focused automation for operational environments, assesses the role of humans in this process, and reflects the outcomes in the metrics. The project's broader significance and importance are focused on triggering a major change in the current attacker mode of operation and shift the SOC landscape from all defenses need to be successful, to all attacks need to be successful to maintain persistent access -- ""turning the tables"" on adversaries. Moreover, this project provides opportunities for curriculum enhancements via integrating research results in cybersecurity courses, affords an opportunity for students to participate in research on security operations, and thereby supports careers in cybersecurity research or professions.<br/><br/>On the technical side, this project explores the integration of the feature-rich DevOps/DevSecOps approaches in dynamic operational environments to establish security baselines. In this context DevOps and DevSecOps are sets of practices that combine software development and IT operations in cybersecurity-related setups. On the human capital side, the research team adopts a sociotechnical approach to study organizational environments by analyzing people and technological artifacts as interacting components. In place of partial, social or technical approaches, the project integrates research and education outcomes so they feed into each other. The project includes an ethnographic SOC fieldwork component, designing multi-segment abstractions for enabling security baselines, an analysis component of the SOC analyst to infrastructure programmer transition, and an evaluation effort of the SOC framework components across different environments. Results are broadly disseminated via publications, presentations/tutorials, and online resources. Overall, the outcomes of this project will evolve the means available to SOCs to significantly increase the burden on attackers and lower their capabilities to compromise enterprise networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Both models raise similar security concerns: As clients lack full control over the service process, they need to make sure that service providers have the right economic incentives to not misbehave. Since the predominant framework in cybersecurity has been motivated by traditional in-house computing, our current thinking about cybersecurity often does not adequately emphasize economic incentives. This project is thus conducting interdisciplinary research to analyze the well-functioning of cyberinfrastructure in the presence of incentive issues. The project aims to enable a more diversified and robust infrastructure; improve digital service efficiency for economic competitiveness; foster competition in digital services provision with technology; bring frontier STEM topics to a broader audience including economists, business researchers, and the general public; and develop education materials to bridge the gap between tech and business students.  <br/><br/>With the overall objective to enrich the existing paradigm for cybersecurity analysis from a cross-disciplinary perspective, the project team is studying several specific topics under the theme, including the principal-agent frictions between cloud clients and providers, and how to deal with it using both contract theory and recent advances in cryptography, the long-term sustainability of decentralized systems featuring interactions among strategic participants as well as Byzantine faults, and the potential of using results from the first two thrusts to organize a more efficient, fair, and inclusive digital economy.

In order to be proficient in these areas, one must draw from a broad set of disciplines. Effective training in such interdisciplinary emerging areas poses several structural and pedagogical challenges. The limited availability of educational resources in these areas often requires educators to collect and curate materials from several sources. Manually developing courses and identifying relevant student learning objectives (SLOs) can be a considerable burden for educators. In addition, learning from courses created this way can be challenging for students. Traditional approaches are not adequate for teaching interdisciplinary areas, since they do not provide the hands-on learning experiences needed to study interactions among disciplines. This project will address the above challenges by developing and disseminating a state-of-the-art experiential learning-based platform, QUINTET: Quantum internet education and training synthesizer. <br/><br/>The QUINTET platform will include: (1) Eight course modules on classical and quantum networking, networking algorithms, quantum internet components and quantum routing, classical and quantum cryptography, and classical and quantum network security; (2) A Learning Objects Repository (LOR) consisting of learning objects that meet SLOs, including modular interactive widgets, relevant text, videos, exercises, and quizzes and tests to synthesize lessons; (3) Use of Kolb?s four phases of experiential learning, including hands-on, virtual quantum network experimentation and universal design for learning, which offers multiple equivalent representations of the same concept for inclusive and accessible learning; (4) New assessment methodology that uses data collection embedded within lesson plans and qualitative assessments that allow instructors and learners to review their performance through reflection zones and active experimentation; and (5) A design in alignment with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Inter-operable, and Reusable) principles and instrumented with a rich set of metadata that allows efficient retrieval and customization of course modules for a variety of learning experiences.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education.

A distributed ledger is a database shared by multiple participants in which each participant or node maintains and updates a synchronized copy of the data. Distributed ledgers allow members to securely verify, execute, and record their own transactions without relying on a central intermediary and provide benefits such as immutability, decentralization of data, and high availability. Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is quickly growing in adoption both in the US and globally. As is true with any emerging technology, distributed ledgers need solutions to support scale, particularly in the context of ledger growth, fast search, and tractable cost of deployment over time.  Further the project will advance private, permissioned blockchains to become viable for production-scale, enterprise use cases spanning sectors like cybersecurity and finance, which both have uncompromising real-time, high transaction throughput constraints. <br/><br/>This STTR Phase II will tackle two key technical objectives: 1) Pruning in enterprise-type DLT systems and 2) Dynamic scaling of deployed DLT platforms. This research will be performed in the context of a widely adopted and open-source DLT technology but will study the implications of both pruning and scaling on factors including security, privacy, consensus, and implementation complexity on distributed ledger technology (DLT) more broadly. To accomplish these objectives, the project will rely on findings from experiments executed and methods developed during the Phase I SBIR research. These include the use of realistic, highly scalable load-testing infrastructure to simulate and benchmark thousands of simultaneous clients. A major research objective of this Phase II work is to develop algorithms for context-aware transaction compression pruning.  This approach to DLT pruning is well suited for enterprise applications where the transaction itself may store a variable amount of data.  This pruning mechanism would substantially advance the state-of-the-art in transaction and state pruning, as it would not require re-syncing of nodes, nor suffer information loss locally, nor damage the ability to reach consensus, and will be optimized for fast search.  Further, this research will examine different classes of applications and discuss which of these could benefit from Corsha?s novel pruning technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will focus on cybersecurity issues in regular expressions. Regular expressions are an important tool used by computer programmers to manipulate data. Regular expressions are applied in many ways, including to validate input in a web form and to check internet traffic for malicious activity. Unfortunately, computer programmers often use regular expressions incorrectly, leading to insecure program behavior. These behaviors result in errors with serious cybersecurity consequences, including allowing malicious actors to steal personal information, seize control of a computer, or cause many websites to crash. This project will address these limitations by improving regular expression engineering practices, and by and making more trustworthy the infrastructure on which regular expressions rely. The team will incorporate undergraduate researchers, develop educational material, and engage with K-12 students. The successful completion of the project will be a significant step towards eliminating cybersecurity incidents related to regular expressions.<br/><br/>This project will design, develop, and evaluate (Part 1) New techniques to make it easier for programmers to re-use high-quality regular expressions; and (Part 2) Novel regex engines that are safe from regular expression denial of service (ReDoS). In Part One, the team proposes processes and tools to help engineers develop correct regexes. The approach is grounded in the re-use paradigm, helping engineers learn from others' expertise. However, to enable re-use, open problems must be addressed in regex indexing, querying, matching, ranking, and comparison. Building on a dataset of 853,818 regexes, the team will develop regex clustering techniques, and integrate novel tool development with user studies to understand modalities and metrics for querying, ranking, and comparison. Synthesizing these techniques, machine learning and new algorithms to enable the reuse-based composition, synthesis, and repair of security sensitive regexes will be applied. Project findings will be embodied in a novel publicly-accessible regex search engine and accompanying tools. In Part Two, the team will improve the trustworthiness of regex engines by eliminating the problematic worst-case characteristics. The team has begun exploring algorithmic advances that address its worst-case super-linear behavior. The team will design a ReDoS-safe algorithm with a provably constant space bound and develop novel worst-case analyses for extended features (e.g., backreferences).

Post-quantum cryptography seeks new cybersecurity solutions for such applications that are resilient to quantum computer attacks.  The National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) is currently evaluating and standardizing such algorithms for mass-scale adoption.  Although these algorithms can be shown to be theoretically secure, their practical implementation can be vulnerable to attacks.  Specifically, adversaries can use the power consumption or electromagnetic radiation of a device running the cryptography algorithm to reverse-engineer computations and steal secret cryptographic keys.  Therefore, practical deployment of next-generation cybersecurity standards requires protected software implementations against such attacks.  At the same time, the validation and application of such defenses need automation to broadly address these vulnerabilities in a variety of computing devices.  The project?s novelties are exposing unknown risks of software running post-quantum cryptography to reverse-engineering attacks and developing a new framework to automatically address those risks.  The project?s broader significance and importance are improving national security and training a cybersecurity-aware science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce.  <br/><br/>This project analyzes side-channel security vulnerabilities in the software implementations of lattice-based cryptography algorithms that were chosen by NIST for post-quantum standardization.  The primary research objective of this project is to develop a framework to automatically expose and mitigate single-trace side-channel vulnerabilities.  Single-trace attacks aim to steal information from a single execution's leakage and are harder to mitigate than those needing repeated measurements.  The project augments low-level virtual machine frameworks by applying static and dynamic program analysis to detect vulnerabilities, and by using program repair with randomization techniques to address the leakage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today?s computer networks have grown both in complexity and in scale, in part as a response to diverse connectivity requirements in the era of the Internet of Things, Cloud 3.0, and Big Data. Existing network management solutions cannot keep up with the demand for solutions to real-time network management problems resulting from these increasingly complex networks. Network management requires a fundamentally new approach in which networks can autonomously control, configure, and manage themselves. While these ?self-driving networks? offer numerous opportunities for efficient network management, they introduce new threats and attack vectors that must be addressed to secure them. Unfortunately, there is currently a shortfall of professionals trained in autonomous and intelligent network security and a shortfall of content with which to train these professionals. This project will address these shortfalls by developing lab-intensive modules that enable undergraduate students to gain fundamental and advanced knowledge in securing next-generation self-driving networks. <br/><br/>The project team will develop six self-contained modules with comprehensive coverage of the techniques, tools, and methods required to secure self-driving networks. The modules will cover (1) attack investigation and analysis of legacy, Software Defined Networking (SDN), and adversarial attacks; (2) hunting for vulnerabilities using static analysis, software component analysis, automated known attack patterns, and behavioral analysis; (3) network-wide data collection using classic and OpenFlow based approaches; (4) protection using runtime application self-protection, automated patching, and security information and event management; (5) evaluation using continuous adaptive risk and thrust assessment; and (6) action using security orchestration, automation and response. In addition, this project aims to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM by organizing workshops and participating in professional conferences. The project team will also organize a workshop to disseminate the modules to interested faculty members from other organizations.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education.

There is a large body of research on how to automatically find vulnerabilities in programs, but test data for evaluation of this research--large, ground-truth corpora of vulnerabilities--are expensive to create and hence in short supply. The goal of this project is to create techniques for automatically generating benchmark corpora of software vulnerabilities that can be used to rigorously assess vulnerability discovery tools, allowing researchers and end users alike to better understand what techniques are most effective, leading to more effective tools and ultimately safer software. The project also aims to use automatically generated vulnerabilities to cheaply create training exercises for cybersecurity education, broadening access to cybersecurity expertise and helping to build the next generation of security researchers.<br/><br/>Although prior work such as LAVA (Large-Scale Automated Vulnerability Addition) has demonstrated that vulnerability corpora can be created automatically, the vulnerabilities it creates are unrealistic (containing many artifacts that made them easier to discover than real vulnerabilities) and not very diverse (consisting only of pointer corruption errors). This project aims to address these issues by developing new techniques that: 1) use large language models trained on code to synthesize vulnerabilities that are realistic and diverse; 2) place vulnerabilities in hard-to-discover paths through directed symbolic execution; 3) allow new vulnerability classes to be added quickly with a customized domain-specific language; and 4) automatically generate exploits for each vulnerability. Together, these techniques will allow highly realistic vulnerability corpora to be generated cheaply and on-demand. Aside from the benefits gained by having a limitless supply of vulnerabilities to use as benchmark corpora, the project will also investigate the use of vulnerability injection to create ""capture the flag""-style exercises for education; such challenges are an extremely popular and effective means of teaching a variety of cybersecurity skills, but they require large amounts of time, money, and expertise to create and manage. If the creation of these challenges can be partially or wholly automated, it could bring new educational opportunities within reach of a broader and more diverse population by dramatically lowering costs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Contemporary biotechnologies often use living systems or living materials ? typically in the form of an engineered cell ? used to treat or diagnose disease, manufacture biofuels, or produce foods or dietary supplements. These could be thought of as biological assets.  Biological security is a process that is used to prevent the unwanted release or capture of a given biological asset, especially if this asset is potentially pathogenic or harmful to the environment. Current approaches to biological security rely primarily on restricting physical access: for instance, the biological assets are confined in high bio-security labs. The current solution lacks any measures to prevent the unwanted proliferation of the biological material once the asset has breached its restricted environment. This is the equivalent of protecting your data by having your cell phone unprotected by a password, but storing it in a locked drawer. Your data is protected, as long as the phone remains locked. However, anybody getting physical possession of the phone will be able to use it and access your data. Similarly, with the current biosecurity approach, anybody can use the biological asset if they get access to it. The objective of this research is to develop bio-security measures that are inherently embedded in the biotechnology asset, much like the embedded password authentication on your phone. This embedded security prevents someone from accessing your data even if they have physical possession of the phone. The successful completion of this research will result in a paradigm shift in biological security and security protocols. In addition to dramatically improving containment and asset protection, the resulting technologies will increase public confidence in the use of engineered biological systems. <br/><br/>The objective of this research is to transition biological security from an operational technology platform to a novel biologically intrinsic informational technology platform. To accomplish this will require the convergence of biological engineering informed by a prescribed set of rules of life, cybersecurity principles, and chemical engineering workflows. Biosecurity predicated on intrinsic informational technology will enable the development of scalable active protection measures and passive containment strategies for any engineered chassis cell or consortium of chassis cells. The use of cybersecurity principles will enable biological engineers and related stakeholders to define and establish the standards and protocols for next-generation biosecurity systems, in addition to staging and conducting penetration tests for the iterative improvement of biological security systems. This plan of action will facilitate use-inspired research via deploying synthetic-decision making and synthetic memory and complementary engineered parts to design, build, and test ascending iterations of biosecurity. Assessment of the impact of next-generation biosecurity will be achieved via a consortium of co-producers that include security specialists, policy makers, industrial partners, and national organizations. In addition, this research program will be used to develop innovative education and training activities aimed at fostering convergent research. The societal impact of this research will be many-fold and is aimed at reducing the anxiety associated with the use of engineer biological systems, increased biosecurity measures that are of interest to national security, and addressing a general interest in improving containment measures from federal institutions to improve biosafety.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This closed-design paradigm has limited the capability of switches to costly proprietary implementations that are hard-coded by vendors. Recently, data plane programmability has attracted significant attention, permitting the owners of communication networks to use switches with customized processing functions. While large companies are now using programmable platforms, campus networks and small- and medium-sized enterprises have yet to fully benefit from the advantages of P4, the de-facto standard for programming the data plane. A key barrier preventing faster adoption of P4 is the availability of engaging training material for cyberinfrastructure (CI) professionals that focuses on the operation and management of P4 systems. This project addresses the gap by developing hands-on virtual labs that run on a platform for online instruction, referred to as the academic cloud. The project will lower the entry barrier to innovation through P4 technology, which will enable CI professionals to reduce the time to design, test, and adopt new communication protocols; devise new customized applications; understand the behavior of data packets as they travel across networks; develop more effective defenses against cybersecurity attacks; and improve the performance of applications used in essential areas such as cybersecurity, Internet of Things (IoT), congestion control, and others.<br/><br/>The first goal of the project is to facilitate the adoption of programmable P4 devices by CI professionals and by network owners in general, by developing virtual labs. The second goal is to promote the integration of P4 and virtual labs into academic degree programs at the associate, bachelor, and graduate levels. Equipment used in virtual labs consists of production-grade devices such as software switches (e.g., Open vSwitch, PISCES), hardware switches based on state-of-the-art Tofino chips, and open-source operating systems and controllers (e.g., Open Network Linux, Open Network Operating System). For virtual labs using physical devices, the equipment pods incorporate P4 programmable hardware switches that are attached to the cloud and are managed via remote-access capability. Virtual labs provide both functional and traffic realism, as they use the same equipment as in real deployments and generate interactive network traffic. They emulate communications across local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), campus networks, data centers, and high-performance systems. The project will organize workshops to create awareness of this new technology and virtual labs resources, and to train CI professionals on P4. Workshops are co-organized and broadly disseminated through collaborators that play a critical role in enhancing and securing the national cyberinfrastructure: ESnet, the high-performance network that carries science traffic for the U.S. Department of Energy, including the National Laboratory system; and Internet2 and Front Range GigaPOP, two Research and Education Networks (RENs) that operate national and regional communication backbones. Finally, in coordination with the Western Academy Support and Training Center, one of the main technical training centers in the U.S. for two- and four-year instruction, and the Network Development Group, a company in virtualized training, the project will train IT instructors interested in the P4 technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the same time, there is a national deficit in highly skilled cyber-security workforce needed to secure the nations cyber infrastructure. Thus, it is a national imperative to develop new and diverse talent with cutting-edge skills and abilities to respond to emerging cyber-threats. This project develops such talent through the infusion of research in undergraduate curricula enabling knowledge development in cybersecurity, machine learning, quantum computing and forensic examination of emerging technologies. Through the curricula, the project builds research capacity at a minority serving institute, preparing student researchers to collaborate with faculty on cutting edge research and creating generations of highly trained graduates.  The main novelty is in drawing on existing STEM focused undergraduate programs, while also casting a wider net to draw in untapped talent by creating a Cyber Bridge from degree programs such as criminal justice, criminology and humanities, to a Master degree in Digital Forensics and Cybersecurity. By expanding the talent pool to draw from, this project also creates opportunities for multi-disciplinary research.<br/><br/>This project creates a research intensive 5-year BS-MS program to prepare undergraduate researchers to contribute to cyber-security research through early immersion into a research methods course and research enhanced 300 and 400 level classes.  The five-year curriculum includes multiple intensive tracks and a Cyber Bridge program that permits students from non-STEM disciplines to make smooth transitions to the third, fourth and fifth years of the BS-MS program. The Cyber Bridge will attract and quickly integrate talented individuals who would otherwise be discouraged from pursuing cyber-focused education/research.

For example, it is often advantageous to have a fleet of lower-cost unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) searching an area than a single, highly capable platform (airship). The nodes in these sophisticated networks, however, are tempting targets for bad actors. Although recognized as a vulnerability for multi-agent systems, current fault-detection methods have significant limitations. This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) award supports research that examines the issue of faulted-agent identification through the lens of Biologically Inspired Design. The objective of this proposal is to design and evaluate a new biologically inspired approach based on ant colonies to identify faulted agents within a swarm, thus increasing resilience. Despite a lack of central control and low individual processing power, ant colonies have sophisticated approaches to identify intruders. The application of this biologically-inspired response to colony intruders will enhance the ability of swarms to identify faulted agents over current approaches. This approach is decentralized, scalable, only requires each agent to have local knowledge, and can be implemented without onboard machine learning. The research serves the interests of the United States in its potential to establish and demonstrate a framework to identify faulted agents without requiring centralized control; it is also scalable and does not require sophisticated agents such as on-board machine learning. These developments have the potential to provide a solution-neutral framework applicable to a variety of vulnerable systems. Increased resilience protects citizens, improves services, and reduces damage after faults; the approach investigated in this work may also help to protect combat drone swarms from infiltration, thereby enhancing our national defense. Finally, outreach activities will involve the local student veteran population, exposing this group to Systems Engineering research and enhancing the future STEM workforce. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to design and validate a faulted agent detection algorithm inspired by the use of Cuticular Hydrocarbon Profiles to identify intruders in ant colonies. The first of three initiatives to achieve this goal is to create a mathematical model of the Cuticular Hydrocarbon Faulted Agent Detection Algorithm (CHC FADA). A solution-neutral faulted agent identification approach will be explored through analysis and modeling of Cuticular Hydrocarbon (CHC) spread in ant colonies. Secondly, the effectiveness of the CHC FADA will be analyzed through a series of simulation-based tests that will examine both equipment failures and Byzantine faults. Third, CHC FAFA will be validated by performing real-world tests with a robotic swarm. Validation includes a student-focused cybersecurity challenge that targets high performing cybersecurity students, as well as veteran students. The outcome of this work is threefold. First, it will document a solution-neutral formulation of a eusocial insect-inspired fault detection approach. The significance of this outcome is a new approach that is decentralized, scalable, only requires each agent to have local knowledge, and can be implemented without onboard machine learning. Secondly, the work will provide measurement of the effectiveness of the new approach. A series of validation tests will be performed with both simulations and our physical test platform. Finally, this work seeks to accomplish initial integration of the local veteran population into Systems Engineering research through the real-world validation testing. This testing will leverage veterans? unique understanding of multi-agent systems, resilience, and system thinking due to their operational experience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The failure to ensure cyber-security can lead to unsafe and potentially catastrophic consequences in chemical process operations, causing environmental damage, capital loss, and human injuries. In recent years, cyber-attacks have been designed by sophisticated adversaries to modify the actuator, the sensor, or the control action, yet remain undetectable by classical detection methods. Therefore, real-time detection of cyber-attacks and mitigation of their effects is an important research problem whose solution could directly impact the safety and security of the chemical process industries. Motivated by these considerations, the goal of this research program is to develop the theory and computational methods needed for detecting and handling intelligent cyber-attacks on process control systems for broad classes of nonlinear processes based on machine learning techniques and encryption tools incorporated within the framework of model-based control methods. User-friendly software will be developed and integrated into the most widely used chemical process CAD software; short courses and workshops will be created to disseminate these computational tools. Furthermore, the research results will be incorporated within the undergraduate process control and senior process design and economics course curricula at UCLA to introduce applications of machine learning techniques in accordance with departmental ABET goals as well as UCLA campus goals on the implementation of a Data Science minor. Finally, the involvement of a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students in the research through participation in the Center for Engineering Education and Diversity at UCLA, and outreach to Community Colleges by offering summer internships to highly qualified students, will be pursued. <br/><br/>The focus of this research program is on the design and implementation of computational methods to prevent cyber-attacks that can compromise data integrity, closed-loop stability, and process operational safety of industrial process control systems. This will be carried out by developing a data-based detection approach using machine learning algorithms to solve classification problems of cyber-attacks using time-series measurement data. Central to this approach is the design of encryption-based model predictive control (MPC) schemes that can operate the process safely and with minimal performance degradation in the presence of cyber-attacks. This will be accomplished through the development of a novel cyber-secure MPC stability-performance control architecture that can detect cyber-attacks and isolate the affected sensors and actuators in the control network while maintaining closed-loop stability. The effectiveness of the resulting cyber-security framework will be demonstrated through applications to high-fidelity, large-scale chemical process networks in an ASPEN simulation environment incorporating industrial process variability data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In those hidden and anonymous environments, cyber criminals discuss how to 1) identify software vulnerabilities, 2) create or purchase exploits, 3) choose a target and recruit collaborators, 4) obtain access to the infrastructure needed, and 5) plan and execute the attack. Although this behavior helps hackers to produce a huge amount of malware, it also provides valuable intelligence for defenders, as the information shared online can be leveraged as precursors to various types of cyber threats. By relying on proactive cyber-threat intelligence analysis, this project addresses the following key research question: can emerging cyber-threats be accurately and aforesaid predicted? With continuous retrieval and analysis of hacker communication, this research will shed light on the assets, capabilities, behaviors, and interests of malicious hackers that can be leveraged for establishing cyber threat prediction.<br/><br/>To accomplish that, two finer-grained problems are being investigated. These investigations constitute the project?s novelties and are key factors for the design of better cyber-defense systems. First, the prediction of software vulnerability exploitation is conducted through classification techniques that correlate hackers' digital traces on hacker forums and marketplaces, and security advisories with real- world hacking attempts. The positive predictions (i.e., it will be exploited) are then ranked for patch prioritization, overcoming two current shortcomings not addressed by machine learning work in this domain: 1) the lack of differentiation of the predicted exploitation and 2) the lack of time interval for predictions. Second, the anticipation of malicious information cascades that might propagate to viral proportions is also performed. Here, classification techniques leveraging social network analysis are used to extract hacker topological information and to estimate social influence, predicting which techniques, strategies, or exploits included in hacking forums might be widely adopted in the near future. Both project efforts will lead to new techniques to predict cyber threats that are time sensitive, giving defenders a better chance in the fight against attackers. The project deliverables, data and models, will be disseminated through the security community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One proposed mitigation strategy is code randomization, where the system scrambles the locations of the code and data in memory, to prevent attackers from gaining advanced knowledge of the memory contents.  Our particular focus is to address a particular type of attack called JIT-ROP, because it can bypass the protection of code randomization. The success of this research will have the potential to revolutionize JIT-ROP countermeasures and shift the balance of the memory attack/counter-attack to the advantage of defenders. Additionally, this project will develop new educational tools to enhance hands-on cybersecurity courses, benefiting students significantly. The PI is committed to engaging minority and under-served populations in cutting-edge research, thereby promoting diversity and inclusion in the field. Collaborations with the open-source community will ensure wide dissemination of the research, fostering further innovation and progress in cybersecurity.<br/><br/>JIT-ROP exploits memory disclosure vulnerabilities to dynamically harvest reusable code gadgets and construct attack payloads on-the-fly. To counteract JIT-ROP attacks, researchers have developed many execute-only memory (XoM) prototypes, which prevent dynamic reading of memory pages. While the concept of XoM is promising in theory, existing solutions face significant challenges in reliability and compatibility, limiting their practical application. These challenges include the inability to handle mixed code and data, incompatibility with commercial off-the-shelf programs, and substantial runtime overhead. This project proposes an innovative approach using a modern CPU feature, Memory Protection Keys, to establish efficient memory permission control mechanisms that accommodate mixed code and data. The first task investigates how to reliably retrofit XoM into stripped binaries on the x86-64 platform. Unlike existing methods, this approach enables legitimate data reads in executable memory without relying on error-prone binary rewriting. The second task explores integrating unreadable ""booby traps"" into JIT-compiled code. These traps act as a novel mechanism to detect JIT-ROP intrusions during runtime memory disclosure, providing timely alerts to potential attacks. In summary, this research aims to overcome the limitations of current XoM solutions, paving the way for more effective JIT-ROP countermeasures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This interdisciplinary team aims to exploit these unique behaviors of 2D material-based field-effect transistors, and to show they can lead to significant improvements in area, speed, and energy-efficiency for both logical and machine learning (ML) applications. To do so, the team will develop 2D ambipolar materials and device structures, design ambipolar logic families and ML architectures, and experimentally demonstrate small-scale and medium-scale circuit prototypes that prove the utility of these materials as building blocks for the next generation of computing systems. This research will lead to a deeper understanding of the control of ambipolar devices, as well as innovations in circuit and system design, that could be used in additional new implementations of nanotechnology. The project will generate energy-efficient technologies to accomplish computing tasks relevant to many sectors of society, including cybersecurity, education, healthcare, and internet-of-things. The three PIs have designed a concerted plan to integrate the outcomes of the proposed work in education and outreach, including interdisciplinary training of students for a strong and bright workforce; designing lectures to expose a larger population of students to the subjects; and designing hands-on activities to reach K-12 girls to increase diversity in science, technology, engineering, and math.<br/><br/>Emerging nanotechnologies exhibit novel switching phenomena that create new opportunities for information processing.

To identify those who are susceptible to phishing attacks, organizations typically self-phish, which is phishing one?s own employees and seeing who responds.  Organizations concerned with cybersecurity may hire services or conduct phishing campaigns themselves.  Self-phishing may only identify those who are extremely susceptible due to the relatively generic phishing emails that are typically used during such campaigns. Organizations that use self-phishing to identify susceptible workers may have a false sense of security.  There is a continuing need for a ways to identify workers susceptible to more complex phishing campaigns. The proposed technology measures users? susceptibility to phishing attacks from publicly available information about those users.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a technology platform to measure individuals in an organization that are susceptible to phishing attacks.  The proposed technology uses publicly available information to quantify users? personality traits, demographics, education, and experiences that are known to predict phishing susceptibility.  That constellation of data is then used to compute an estimate how susceptible each user is to a phishing attack.  The proposed platform may enhance an organization's efforts to identify individuals who would most benefit from security awareness training.  In addition, the proposed technology may have a broad impact on enhancing penetration testing that targets people who are operating critical infrastructure, i.e., the weakest links in security systems.

Across the globe, software is integral to many aspects of contemporary life, making it crucial to be able to accurately identify and verify the components from which software is created. A well-known method for creating an inventory of software components, known as a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), is prone to inaccuracies and is vulnerable to unauthorized tampering. This project, called ?SBOMit,? aims to transform SBOMs by creating an open-source ecosystem that redefines how SBOMs are produced and checked. The SBOMit open-source ecosystem aligns with both the NSF's mission to enhance national welfare and security as well as the objectives of the National Cybersecurity Strategy. SBOMit minimizes the risks of tampering with SBOMs and improves transparency, establishing a new benchmark for trust in software supply chains. As an open-source product, SBOMit is available to industry, government, and other sectors at no cost, providing a free and open solution to one of the most important cybersecurity problems. <br/><br/>SBOMit's innovation builds upon the capabilities of another open-source product, known as ?in-toto,? to bolster SBOM reliability against malicious threats, leveraging the in-toto framework?s attestations to enhance SBOM trustworthiness. The in-toto framework ensures cryptographic verification at every stage of the supply chain, providing assurance of software integrity for version control systems, the continuous integration/continuous deployment process, testing, and all other stages of the software supply chain. Cryptographic verification serves dual purposes: diminishing SBOM tampering risks and setting a new transparency and trust standard in software supply chains. Additionally, the capability to leverage in-toto's attestations helps to fortify software against a variety of existing and anticipated software supply chain attacks. Industry participants within the growing SBOMit ecosystem are developing tools that will help to integrate the product across a diverse range of applications, fostering a community-driven approach that will protect software used in industry, government, academia, and elsewhere. The detailed metadata embedded within SBOMs by in-toto attestations facilitates a greater level of visibility and control of the provenance of components, empowering automated verification processes that can detect and defend against unauthorized modifications. As the SBOMit open-source ecosystem expands by integrating the product across various software domains, this standardizes a means to generate SBOMs and empower stakeholders across sectors with transparent, secure, and easy-to-use tools. The SBOMit open-source ecosystem can pave the way for the trustworthy software supply chain of the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rapid analysis of obfuscated malware is vital for a swift response to emerging threats, such as ransomware. This research project advances human knowledge on defeating obfuscated malware. The project's novelties are the new knowledge revealed from the state-of-the-art obfuscation, the new techniques designed for extracting the knowledge, and the new deobfuscation methods for understanding such type of stealthy malware. The project's broader significance and importance are new cybersecurity learning experiences for K-12/undergraduate/graduate students, and new technologies for national cybersecurity against a wide range of emerging malware threats, with high potential for transition to practice. <br/><br/>The insight of this project is to leverage the virtualization technique itself to beat modern virtualization obfuscators. Two major features play a crucial role in the success of virtualization obfuscation: sophistication (the obfuscated form is very complex and different from the original program) and diversification (multiple obfuscated forms of the same program strikingly vary). These features heavily impede existing deobfuscation techniques that rely on recognizing special virtual machine patterns or treating the whole virtualization as a black box. This project invents and implements a series of novel methods to: (1) comprehensively probe the sophisticated structures inside virtual machines, such as interpretation architecture, virtual instructions, and handler encryption, (2) reveal the core techniques to combine, mutate, and randomize diverse virtual machines, and (3) build a new, interpretable virtual machine specifically for deobfuscation, which can be stitched into a simple, executable program as the deobfuscation result.

However, current solutions lack a holistic understanding of cyber-physical resilience in complex systems, failing to connect IIoT network vulnerabilities with dynamic manufacturing processes for effective detection and control. To address these gaps, this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project aims to develop novel methodologies that integrate modeling, detection, and control measures for understanding the cyber-physical resilience of continuous critical manufacturing systems. This study will work to eliminate barriers to the development of new policies, regulations, and standards for IIoT applications in manufacturing. In collaboration with industry stakeholders, this project promises long-term benefits by extending its methods and tools to other critical infrastructures, thereby enhancing national cyber-physical resilience. Meanwhile, the education and outreach activities in this project foster sustained awareness of cyber-physical resilience among both future and current manufacturing professionals. Introducing new courses and training materials enhances students' exposure to advanced manufacturing technologies and improves their data science and cybersecurity skills. K-12 outreach initiatives boost understanding of IIoT and cyber-physical resilience, promoting manufacturing careers. A specially designed training software addresses the need for intuitive cybersecurity training in engineering language. These endeavors align with the National Strategy for Advanced Manufacturing by contributing to the goal of ensuring national security.<br/><br/>This study addresses critical challenges in continuous manufacturing systems' cyber-physical resilience. The research objectives include (1) Development of Generalizable Tools: The project aims to build generalizable tools for cyber-physical resilience quantification. By creating stochastic models that integrate cyber connectivity and system dynamics of heterogeneous components, a novel quantification metric will be established. This metric considers both IIoT network features and manufacturing system dynamics through stochastic optimization, revealing system-level risks induced by IIoT connectivity. (2) Rethinking Anomaly Detection: The project will rethink cyber-physical resilience-driven anomaly detection by incorporating system-wide resilience quantification into process-based anomaly detection algorithms. This involves designing novel semi-supervised learning algorithms that incorporate resilience, with a focus on understanding the theories governing detection accuracy and resilience enhancement in high-dimensional data-driven anomaly detection. (3) Collaborative Learning-Based Resilient Control Strategies: The study aims to create collaborative learning-based resilient control strategies. Leveraging reinforcement learning and system connectivity, these strategies enhance a system's adaptability to cyberattacks. This involves exploring the under-explored area of vertical federated reinforcement learning and generating new knowledge regarding the trade-off between the control performance of individual machines and the system's adaptability to adversaries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This includes advances in cryptography, faster calculations, and better understanding of natural processes taking place at the atomic level. Because of its spanning impact, QIS addresses many areas of national interest, including cybersecurity,  pharmaceuticals, financial services, health care, among others. QIS involves a fundamentally different logic than classical information science, and advances in the field (in areas such as quantum algorithms and quantum cryptography) have often depended on creative mathematical breakthroughs. Furthermore, mathematics is an accessible entry point to QIS for students and mentors from a wide range of backgrounds and skill levels. With these principles in mind, this project strengthens both mathematics and QIS by training mathematicians to enter the world of quantum research. A holistic curriculum guides program participants from learning quantum principles to applying sophisticated mathematical tools to advance QIS, while also exploring the societal impact of their research. This project will support the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoc fellows from the Mathematical Sciences, to be mentored by faculty who are leaders in fields relevant to mathematics and quantum science. By expanding QIS training to Mathematics, this project will contribute to a more robust and diverse QIS workforce.<br/><br/>This project will advance mathematics by tackling cutting-edge theoretical questions within three research themes that are mature enough to allow for mathematical treatment and innovation: Quantum Algorithms, Quantum Cryptography, and Quantum Systems. Each of these themes has rigorous mathematical models (that the community agrees are useful) and these models rise to an abundance of mathematical problems that are yet to be explored and whose solution is likely to have high impact on scientific computing, cybersecurity, and nanotechnology. Fifteen faculty will mentor undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers in QIS projects that draw from algebra/representation theory, nonlinear analysis, partial differential equations, scientific computing, and stochastic analysis. Research goals will include: to develop new and enhance existing quantum algorithms, to use the power of mathematics to expand the range and usefulness of quantum cryptography, and to improve Quantum Information Science through advances in quantum systems theory and vice versa. The project is expected to stimulate the research and careers of mathematicians by equipping them to pursue research in Quantum Information Science, both at the University of Maryland, College Park level and at the national level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research on quantum networks has the potential to contribute to fundamental discoveries in quantum science as well as key applications in cybersecurity, quantum sensors, and quantum computing. However, to realize the promised advantages of a quantum Internet, many fundamental science and engineering challenges must be overcome. Tackling these challenges will require a convergence of expertise from science and engineering disciplines and the development of a well-trained, interdisciplinary quantum networks workforce. The overarching goal of this NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) project is to advance the design and development of components and applications of quantum networks, and to establish the first comprehensive, interdisciplinary quantum information science and engineering (QISE) training program in the Southeast. Representing a collaboration between the University of Georgia and the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, this training program is expected to serve fifty-four masters and doctoral students, including thirty-four funded trainees in science and engineering.<br/><br/>This project will carry out quantum networks research in three key areas. The first centers on quantum network building blocks: single photon emitters, qubit realization, quantum photon measurement, quantum information theory, and cybersecurity. The second encompasses quantum devices: networked quantum computing, networked quantum sensors, and materials for quantum network components. The third area considers scientific and engineering applications: space-based entangled photon sources, quantum random number generators, the power grid, quantum resource estimation, and on-chip technology. These three research thrusts will be bridged by three cross-disciplinary research perspectives: experimentation, simulation, and engineering. The training program and workforce development will significantly contribute to fulfilling the pressing need for a skilled QISE workforce in academia, national laboratories, and industry. It will include components uniquely designed to increase the involvement of diverse students in QISE. It will strengthen existing ties that the two collaborating institutions have with historically black colleges and universities, and the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Leadership and Academic Enhancement Program, for robust recruitment, mentoring, and retention of women and minority students from groups underrepresented in the field. In addition, it will engage potential undergraduate recruits with QISE topics via introductory QISE courses that can be taken for credit across institutions. This traineeship model will create an interdisciplinary, workforce-aligned program integrating experimental, simulational, and engineering experiential learning to galvanize a diverse community of graduate students toward careers in QISE.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

Identifying events to describe who did what to whom and their relations (causal, subevent, and coreferential) from a large amount of text can provide valuable data to support intelligent applications and data-driven decisions over various domains. However, current event structure extraction systems can only perform over text data for a few popular languages such as English, Chinese, Spanish, and Arabic. Text data from many other languages in the world thus cannot be processed by current event extraction systems. This limitation has hindered the coverage of data sources for the systems, introduced language biases in the extracted events, and delayed updates with latest events in local reports. Eventually, the collected event data from current techniques cannot comprehensively represent the latest dynamics over the world to effectively support decision making for important problems of national interests. To address the multilingual challenges, this project will develop event extraction and event-event relation extraction systems that can be effective for data in multiple languages, emphasizing on understudied and low-resource languages to improve the coverage of extracted data and promote democratization of technologies. In information retrieval, multilingual event structure data from the developed technologies can enable data management systems to quickly obtain answers and create summaries for broader user queries in many more languages. In cybersecurity, databases for extracted cyber attack events from multilingual sources can be used to generate more fine-grained and comprehensive reports to inform resource allocation decisions to better protect online activities. In socio-political science, coded conflict and meditation events from more languages can increase the scope and reduce biases of the data to support better decisions for foreign policy, civil war prevention, environmental challenges, or economic strategies.<br/><br/>This project will address three fundamental limitations of existing multilingual learning research for event structure extraction: (i) the lack of multilingual datasets that provide data annotation for multiple languages to sufficiently support generalization evaluation of models across different language families, (ii) the limitations of current multilingual representation learning methods when aligning representations between languages to induce language-general features, and (iii) the scarcity of labeled data in different languages to train multilingual models. First, the project will annotate documents for all event extraction and event-event relation extraction tasks in many more languages using consistent schemas. The selected languages for annotation will be typologically diverse, understudied and low-resource to provide reliable multilingual evaluation data for the developed methods. Second, to boost cross-lingual performance for event structure extraction, this project will devise multilingual representation learning methods to enable effective knowledge transfer where models trained on labeled data of high-resource languages can be directly applied to data of other languages. The project will develop novel representation alignment methods for different languages using representation matching, augmentation, and language-general structure induction for text. Third, concerning limited training data for multilingual learning, this project will develop novel methods to automatically generate labeled data in different languages. The project will introduce techniques to mitigate noises in the generated data and optimize generation procedures to boost multilingual learning and performance.

In these fields, the statistical validity of the results produced by these methods is paramount: false discoveries cannot be tolerated. Current methods do not offer such stringent statistical guarantees. This project develops algorithms for statistically-sound Knowledge Discovery from Data. It transforms the field by shifting the goal of the Knowledge Discovery process from extracting information about the available data to gaining new understanding of the noisy, random process that generates the data. The proposed methods contribute towards a faster and higher-throughput scientific pipeline, by allowing scientists and practitioners to efficiently analyze rich large datasets and to trust the results of the analysis. Researchers can then focus on their discipline-specific research tasks without worrying about computational or statistical considerations. The project includes collaborations with a local museum and a local public library, to analyze data about their collections of historic materials, and with a  cybersecurity company to develop methods for fast detection of network attacks with few false positives. A diverse cohort of undergraduate students will be involved in the research and educational components of the project.<br/><br/>Research in knowledge discovery has mostly focused on understanding the available data, rather than the process that generated it. In the few cases where hypothesis testing was used to assess the results (mostly for simple patterns), only simplistic null models were considered, and the testing employed low-statistical-power approaches (e.g., the Bonferroni correction) to control only for one measure of false discovery, the Family-Wise Error Rate. This project is transformative because it will develop efficient methods for evaluating a wide variety of results (e.g., patterns, anomalies, graph/vertex/edge properties, and more) obtained from large rich datasets (e.g., transactional datasets, graphs, and time series), using realistic null models which are more appropriate for these tasks, and better encode available knowledge of the data generating process. We will create novel efficient procedures to sample from such models, both approximate (e.g., Markov-Chain Monte Carlo) and exact, and combine them with modern resampling- based multiple testing methods, in a multiple-hypothesis first approach that also controls the (marginal) False Discovery Rate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To address the dire gender disparity in computing, the project will design and research the curriculum to engage female students. Through studying the impact of innovative computing tools and curricular units on learning, attitudes, interests, and collaboration of students (and especially young women), the project will advance discovery and understanding to aid the cause of broadening participation in technology-related careers as well as the future of work at the human-technology frontier.

In this type of attack, an adversary exploits similarities and confusion in names of domains and resources in cyber space (e.g., Amazon.com vs. Amazom.com) to target users and even software developers, leading to financial loss, intellectual property theft, reputation damage, and disruption of normal operations for unsuspecting users. The project?s novelty is the assessment of the security risks of these types of attacks systematically and quantitatively across vital platforms and applications, including software supply chain ecosystems, the Metaverse, and decentralized financial applications (Web3). This investigation also enables the development of effective defense mechanisms and provides a strong safety guarantee to Internet users. The project's broader significance and importance lie in securing current and future Internet applications, thereby enhancing the availability and reliability of Internet services. Additionally, educational efforts are devoted to the curriculum design of new cybersecurity courses with a focus on Web3 applications. Outreach activities are also conducted to promote the involvement of underrepresented minorities in computing and to enhance cybersecurity awareness and knowledge in the states of Virginia and Delaware (an EPSCoR state).<br/><br/>This project develops multiple frameworks to continuously monitor and capture any suspicious activities and pinpoint potential naming space hijacking issues.

Among the ICTs, the Internet of Things (IoT) plays a crucial role in filling the gap between the control and monitoring of electricity services and physical grid dynamic processes. The widespread implementation of IoT devices significantly improves the CPES's operational performance, but it also exposes the grid to vast cyber threats. It has been revealed that the adversary can disrupt the CPES operations through IoT botnet attacks by compromising a large number of IoT-operated energy devices in the power distribution system and using them as a means to launch a coordinated cyber-physical attack. Classical approaches to trustworthy CPES focus on improving cybersecurity to prevent attacks or enhancing physical resiliency to restore the system operation after attacks. However, solely relying on either approach is not a viable solution as achieving perfect security or resiliency is extremely cost-prohibitive, if not impossible. To this end, this project aims to devise cost-effective and holistic mechanisms for enhancing both the security and resiliency of CPES under large-scale IoT botnet attacks. The design paradigm will jointly mitigate the risks of the cyber components and equip the physical grid with agile recovery capability.<br/><br/>The project will develop a unified theoretical framework to facilitate grid operators' decentralized, strategic, and integrative decision-making on security and resiliency strategies in CPES. Specifically, the project will first establish a quantitative framework for analyzing the systemic cyber-physical risks imposed by the massive IoT-controlled energy devices in the microgrid. This systemic risk model will then be integrated with the microgrid's operation framework to study the attacker's strategic behavior in destabilizing the grid. The adversarial analysis facilitates uncovering the most vulnerable locations in the microgrids, which is leveraged to guide the strategic defense. The second research thrust will establish a dynamic game to enable the integrated design of proactive cyber defense and physical resiliency planning strategies for networked microgrids. The multi-layer multi-stage game-theoretic design provides preventive security mechanisms to harden the cyber components of CPES and corrective resiliency measures to improve the preparedness of the physical grid for attacks. The project will further develop distributed learning-based mechanism for the microgrid operators to counteract the strategic adversaries adaptively. The developed techniques and results in this project will be demonstrated using public power system simulation tools. The PI will integrate the research outcomes into the engineering, data science, and cybersecurity curriculum, providing students cross-disciplinary training in cyber-physical smart grids, security and resilience, and artificial intelligence.

Research on quantum networks has the potential to contribute to fundamental discoveries in quantum science as well as key applications in cybersecurity, quantum sensors, and quantum computing. However, to realize the promised advantages of a quantum Internet, many fundamental science and engineering challenges must be overcome. Tackling these challenges will require a convergence of expertise from science and engineering disciplines and the development of a well-trained, interdisciplinary quantum networks workforce. The overarching goal of this NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) project is to advance the design and development of components and applications of quantum networks, and to establish the first comprehensive, interdisciplinary quantum information science and engineering (QISE) training program in the Southeast. Representing a collaboration between the University of Georgia and the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, this training program is expected to serve fifty-four masters and doctoral students, including thirty-four funded trainees in science and engineering.<br/><br/>This project will carry out quantum networks research in three key areas. The first centers on quantum network building blocks: single photon emitters, qubit realization, quantum photon measurement, quantum information theory, and cybersecurity. The second encompasses quantum devices: networked quantum computing, networked quantum sensors, and materials for quantum network components. The third area considers scientific and engineering applications: space-based entangled photon sources, quantum random number generators, the power grid, quantum resource estimation, and on-chip technology. These three research thrusts will be bridged by three cross-disciplinary research perspectives: experimentation, simulation, and engineering. The training program and workforce development will significantly contribute to fulfilling the pressing need for a skilled QISE workforce in academia, national laboratories, and industry. It will include components uniquely designed to increase the involvement of diverse students in QISE. It will strengthen existing ties that the two collaborating institutions have with historically black colleges and universities, and the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Leadership and Academic Enhancement Program, for robust recruitment, mentoring, and retention of women and minority students from groups underrepresented in the field. In addition, it will engage potential undergraduate recruits with QISE topics via introductory QISE courses that can be taken for credit across institutions. This traineeship model will create an interdisciplinary, workforce-aligned program integrating experimental, simulational, and engineering experiential learning to galvanize a diverse community of graduate students toward careers in QISE.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

However, the increasing digitization of ICSs, involving sensing, communication, and control, brings advanced features but also exposes vulnerabilities to malicious cyber-attacks. Protecting ICSs from such attacks is crucial due to the potential catastrophic physical damages they can cause. The project aims to develop a comprehensive solution, integrating human-on-the-loop explainable machine learning (ML), detection, and recovery control in an operator-automation shared protection framework, to provide security and safety-assured ICSs against malicious cyber-attacks. Moreover, the project will incorporate engineering research and education to train students, particularly those from Under-Represented Minorities (URM), and cultivate a diverse, globally competitive cybersecurity workforce. With the goal of lowering barriers to ICSs security research and education, this project aims to have a significant impact by providing accessible testbeds for a diverse population of beginning and expert cybersecurity students and engineers to learn and practice.<br/><br/>The underlying concept of process anomaly detection, which is used for detecting cyber-attacks, involves comparing observed and expected behaviors based on physical invariants. The data-driven approach has the advantage of automatically discovering these physical invariants without requiring domain expertise. However, existing approaches based on black-box Machine Learning (ML) often overlook the role of system operators in safety-critical ICSs. The lack of insightful explanations in detection results hinders system operators from conducting troubleshooting and isolating anomalous sensors and actuators under attack, which is necessary for scheduling online recovery. To address this issue, the PI's team proposes to develop an operator-automation shared protection framework that unifies human-on-the-loop explainable ML, detection, and recovery control. This framework aims to enable real-time decision-making using cutting-edge ML and control techniques while valuing the feedback of human operators to prevent over-trust in autonomy in a safety-critical system. The research project has three major objectives: 1) The PI's team will develop insightful hybrid automata learning that captures physical invariants in a way that system operators can understand the model and the detection results, verify and correct the model, and localize anomalies; 2) A real-time provably safe control under uncertainty will be designed to restore the system to normal operation without violating safety constraints; and 3) the PI?s team will evaluate, demonstrate, and disseminate best practices of the proposed framework on 3D simulated and real testbeds with portability across a wide range of ICSs for lowering the barriers to ICSs security research and education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Therefore, it is imperative to prioritize safety as a fundamental aspect across various domains of AI research. Notably, due to the ubiquity of network (graph) data, network learning techniques have strongly impacted AI in the past decade, being widely deployed across applications such as social networks, healthcare, and cybersecurity. However, real-world networks often include challenges like data issues and unforeseen environmental hazards, resulting in risky AI techniques and unsafe outcomes when these networks are employed. Existing studies for safe network learning lack versatility, efficiency, and comprehensive integration across multiple safety dimensions. They struggle to ensure timely, safe predictions in practical scenarios and fail to holistically address data, model, and usage aspects. These challenges collectively hinder their capability and effectiveness, and there is currently a lack of a holistic framework to adequately tackle safety issues in network learning. To bridge this research gap, the goal of this project is to design, develop, and evaluate a novel Safety-centric Network Learning framework (SNL) for safe decision-making on networks in the wild. The project outcomes will substantially impact network learning research and offer advanced solutions to address challenges across diverse domains such as public health, cybersecurity, and social media. Additionally, the project will foster interdisciplinary collaborations and facilitate technology transfer to industry. The project outcomes will be made publicly accessible and broadly disseminated. Moreover, the project will integrate research with education through novel curriculum development and student mentoring activities with an emphasis on underrepresented groups, aiming to train and educate future generations in effectively developing and utilizing AI while also ensuring AI safety. <br/><br/>The project will involve comprehensive efforts to develop SNL that prioritizes the critical safety dimensions of reliability, stability, and explainability, and further encompasses the crucial aspects of data, model, and usage in a general, efficient, and integrated manner. Formally, SNL will provide reliable network data and network learning models (reliability) while generating stable and consistent outputs (stability) accompanied by easily understandable usage explanations (explainability). Specifically, the research components that engage innovative theories, algorithms, and models in this project are fourfold. First, design novel network learning algorithms to identify and generate reliable network data that are minimally impacted by data and environmental issues. Second, create new network representation learning models and training strategies to promote efficiency and reliability in learning network representations. Third, devise innovative data-to-model optimization theories to ensure the stability of network learning. Finally, develop novel generative learning methods to advance the usage explainability and output receptivity of network learning. The unified framework allows seamless collaboration and mutual reinforcement among different research components. Through the convergent research program, the project will not only make significant advancements in network learning and AI safety research but also shed novel insights to tackle various societal challenges, ultimately benefiting society at large.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In other words, if you ask any number of people to show you how they ?implemented? their Zero Trust environment with the same initial specifications you will get at a minimum number of responses with varying levels of verifiable security. The multiple responses are not the problem in this case as much as the variability in the level of security due to the ill-posed question of trust in these systems.

Integration of connectivity features into modern vehicles is a main driving force behind the ever-expanding attack surface of connected AVs, rendering them vulnerable to hacking and data theft. Key vulnerabilities arise from the increased coupling of unsecured automotive control networks with multimedia networks and the integration of wireless interfaces such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi networks. As such, developing robust and reliable solutions to identify, localize, and mitigate cybersecurity threats to connected AVs is of societal importance. Existing solutions, however, are limited in their ability and scope as they are unable to reliably link the received data to the transmitting devices. The goal of this project is to safeguard AVs against growing attack surfaces and vectors by developing a holistic solution called the Linking2Source framework through three seamlessly integrated layers of defense, with each layer aiming to mitigate a specific set of attacks. The project also has a significant educational component, consisting of a set of inquisitive hands-on activities involving vehicle data acquisition, decoding, and data analytics, network packet injection, and intrusion detection aimed at outreach and broadening participation in STEM disciplines, including automotive cybersecurity, cyber-physical system security, statistical data analysis and digital forensics.<br/><br/>The first layer of the proposed Linking2Source framework aims to protect in-vehicle networks by developing real-time message authentication, intrusion detection, and localization tools based on unclonable signal attributes for physical fingerprinting of electronic control units (ECUs). The approach exploits uniqueness in physical signal attributes, leverages statistical signal processing and parameter modeling techniques for physical fingerprint estimation, and uses statistical machine learning methods for transmitting ECU identification and localization. The second layer aims to protect in-vehicle networks against firmware/software-level attacks using ECU behavioral fingerprinting through data-driven statistical graph analytics. The approach targeted by the research team here is the transformation of sequential in-vehicle network data into a directed-graph to leverage statistical graph analytics for ECU behavior modeling and intrusion detection. The third layer of defense aims to protect AVs against attacks at the sensing and actuation layer by using dynamical observers that rely on vehicle-physics-based modeling for fault detection and isolation. The faulty signals such as incorrect steering angle commands that are issued by the rogue ECUs and are not in agreement with the vehicle physics could cause unsafe maneuvers such as excessive yaw motions. The project exploits the physics-based vehicle model for verifying the correctness of the issued ECU signals over the in-vehicle network bus. By leveraging the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, the decisions from these layers of defense are optimally fused to integrate the three defense solutions in the Linking2Source framework. A key component of this project is to use in-vehicle network data both at the physical and datalink layers for modeling physical, behavioral, and vehicle-state fingerprints and using them for attack detection and localization and mitigation of the impact of malicious ECUs using a proactive cancellation policy. The research team will prototype the proposed solutions and evaluate them on the University of Michigan-Dearborn shuttle, on the University of Michigan MCity Test Facility, and on commercial tools, in addition to collecting large-scale data from a network testbed and from a real vehicle driving and sharing it with the research community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, the majority of approaches for detecting such network-wide attacks require centralized data aggregation and computation leading to privacy and security concerns, high decision latency and significant hardware and software upgrade costs. The project novelties pertain to the decentralized detection of network-wide, data-driven cyberattacks without the need to move sensitive operational data from the stakeholders. The project broader significance and importance are in the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce geared towards bolstering national industrial cybersecurity; and enhanced STEM participation of undergraduate students especially from underrepresented groups through a series of workshops and hackathons targeting industrial cybersecurity preparedness.<br/> <br/>This project serves as a key enabler for new research directions pertaining to decentralized algorithmic and computational frameworks for cyberattack detection that deliver publicly verifiable detection outcomes.

These adversaries employ crafted inputs to exploit undisclosed or unpatched security flaws (bugs) in protocol implementations. Despite the common strategy of bug identification and patching, unearthing elusive bugs in protocol implementations remains challenging as it requires navigating stringent input validation to discover bugs that lurk deep in the code. Fuzzing, endorsed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), automates security testing by passing abnormal inputs to programs in order to discover bugs. While fuzzing has effectively uncovered bugs in many real-world systems, it still struggles to generate semantically correct inputs essential for testing beyond initial input validation. This project bridges this gap in traditional fuzzing by developing an innovative automated solution that effectively enhances the testing of protocol implementations. <br/><br/>The core objective of this project is to develop an automated, context-sensitive fuzzing approach that effectively uncovers bugs in security-critical protocol implementations. This project realizes its objective through activities across three complementary research thrusts. The first thrust designs a domain specific language to encode context-sensitive hierarchical structures of inputs and develops algorithms to efficiently generate semantically correct inputs. The second thrust devises several mutation techniques, essential for fuzzing, that will maintain the context-sensitivity of the input. The third thrust develops mechanisms to faithfully maintain the internal state of a stateful protocol so that each fuzz input can be tested in a suitable state of the protocol.<br/><br/>This project has the potential to significantly enhance the robustness of protocol implementations, benefiting society.

Microfluidics refers to the interdisciplinary study of fluid manipulation at nanoliter/picoliter volumes. Microfluidic lab-on-chip systems are integrated with sensors and intelligent control, networked for data analysis, and are being commercialized for use in medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and basic laboratory research. These systems are cyberphysical in nature and are unfortunately coming of age in an era of rampant cybersecurity issues. Consequently, we anticipate novel security and trust problems that need to be addressed using interdisciplinary expertise in microfluidics, microbiology, hardware design, and cybersecurity. <br/><br/>This project is a collaboration between Duke University and New York University (NYU). It includes four thrusts: 1) understanding the security threats, motivations, attack surfaces, and their consequences for the research landscape, industry, and society, 2) developing security and trust techniques to prevent, detect, and mitigate these threats, 3) experimental validation on the benchtop using biomolecular protocols, and 4) fabrication of printed circuit board (PCB) lab-on-chip prototypes with security primitives. The methods used to realize the research goals will draw upon the multidisciplinary and synergistic expertise of the investigators: microfluidic biochips, threat analysis and countermeasures; bioprotocol synthesis; design automation; experimental microbiology. <br/><br/>This project will foster multi-disciplinary research and education for students in hardware design, CAD, molecular biology, and security. Growth and investment in CPMS, adoption by end users, will be fostered by intellectual property protection. This project has the potential to pave the way for new tech companies. CPMS designed with security in mind will restore trust after the many recent publicized violations of diagnostic and research integrity. The attacks and defense techniques will be submitted to the annual embedded systems security challenge (ESC) held at NYU, where the strengths of the security techniques are being evaluated by student hardware hackers. <br/><br/>All data related to this project will be disseminated through the DukeSpace repository, https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/.

While there are several reasons behind this proliferation of exploitable bugs, the reliance on unsafe programming languages such as C and C++ and the complexity of modern software play a major role. The continuous discovery of previously unknown (zero-day) vulnerabilities in browsers, document viewers, and other widely used software, and the lack of effective defenses against recent exploitation techniques that leverage memory disclosure vulnerabilities, necessitate the development of additional defense mechanisms.<br/><br/>The main objective of this project is the design of software shielding techniques and their practical applicability to commodity software and systems. The key innovative aspects of the investigated techniques include: i) principled design that considers the strong adversarial models imposed by the latest exploitation advancements, i.e., disclosure-aided exploitation and data-only attacks, against which effective countermeasures remain an open problem; ii) novel code specialization and data protection techniques, to introduce process-level unpredictability and limit the exposure of critical data; iii) hardware-assisted implementation by leveraging recent and upcoming processor features to minimize the performance impact of the applied protections; and iv) focus on practical considerations, such as operational compatibility and non-disruptive deployment. The outcomes of this research effort are expected to improve the state of the art in defenses against advanced exploits, and achieve substantial practical impact by shielding existing vulnerable applications against exploitation, benefiting both end users and security researchers.

In the efforts of modernizing the critical national infrastructures, advanced sensor and communication technologies are playing an important role in enhancing their operational efficiency and offering finer view on the human inaccessible physical processes. However, this has potential to jeopardize the security of the operational technology and expand the cyber threat landscape, which opens opportunities of cyber exploitation to the underlying data, devices, and the physical processes. This project investigates how to devise an overhead aware provenance framework to incorporate implicit local resiliency in the critical infrastructure that assures data and operational trustworthiness while thwarting rogue devices through continuous lightweight authentications. To further enhance the cyber resiliency of the critical infrastructure sector as a whole, this project also explores on designing distributed information sharing models that promotes reciprocity and reduces the risks of cyber exploitation. In addition to the research contributions, this project has a tightly integrated education plan which involves developing critical infrastructure security skill sets among next generation engineers, summer training for the middle and high school teachers to induce cybersecurity interests in their classrooms and disseminating new critical infrastructure security knowledge to regional and national stakeholders. The outcomes of the project have significant value to the operators of the critical infrastructure sector to better understand and address the underlying cyber challenges in a timely and collaborative manner.<br/><br/>Achieving resilience in critical national infrastructures against emerging cyber threats poses a significant challenge as more and more network capable operational technology components are being deployed, making the operational environment complex, interdependent, and highly heterogeneous. This project particularly focuses on enhancing cyber resiliency of the operational technology through two major objectives: First, devise overhead aware provenance mechanisms that the critical infrastructure entities can adopt locally to have an implicit resiliency against diverse cyber attacks. The provenance schemes ensure trustworthiness of the data generated from various physical processes in the operational technology environment, while accurately identifying the associated devices and assuring the integrity of state changes made by the physical processes. Second, develop community wide cyber resilience by designing distributed cyber information sharing mechanisms that allows disparate stakeholders to collaborate and effectively communicate their cyber knowledge for proactively defending the national cyber infrastructure. With the interdisciplinary research components from computer science, cybersecurity, industrial and systems engineering, embedded systems, economics, and game theory, this project contributes to the understanding of the effectiveness of data and process provenance for cyber resiliency, the integration challenges of continuous lightweight authentication for device trustworthiness, the impact of cyber information sharing on overall risk posture of operational technology, and the factors contributing to induce reciprocity in information sharing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Generative AI systems can violate the property and privacy rights of the people whose data are used to build them. They can also be used to generate content that might trick people into making mistakes that affect their security, privacy, and beliefs. On the other hand, generative AI systems might be used to support security and privacy goals. They may be able to create synthetic data that helps detect and predict new attacks more rapidly, which in turn could be used to make safer software, policies, and security operations practices. This project's goal is to support the planning of a large-scale proposal to study the risks and benefits that Generative AI-based systems may pose to security and privacy, developing methods to increase their safety and usefulness for society.<br/><br/>The project's goal is to develop a fully realized proposal in terms of the scientific questions, team and partnerships, and social impacts to be addressed. To do this the research team will start with project ideation and identification of key stakeholders in both the scientific and social impact realms.

This project will engage students in hands-on field experience, laboratory/project-based entrepreneurship tasks and mentorship experiences in fields of computing, specifically in cybersecurity. This project, based on the use of a Project Based Learning (PBL) environment with high school students, is a partnership between Tuskegee University, Auburn University, a rural and an urban school district in the historic Black Belt region of the state of Alabama, Tuskegee University Engineering and Computer Science Alumni Associations, and the Alabama State Department of Education. The focus of the partnership is to recruit annually a cohort of forty ethnically and racially diverse high school students from the partnering school districts for immersion in a STEM intensive PBL four-week STEM Summer Academy hosted by Tuskegee University, followed by one semester in-school training. The Academy is designed to provide 40 rising 10th and 11th grade students and ten high-school teachers annually (150 over the life of the three-year grant) with far-reaching technological experiences through the exciting exploration of secured mobile application development under a PBL framework. <br/><br/>The project will provide, in a group setting, hands-on training in basic information technology and information security concepts through a one-month training program (4-week Summer Academy) hosted at Tuskegee University, a Historically Black University, followed by one semester in school training on a project of their choice.  Each of the groups will be assisted by a computer science faculty of Tuskegee University. The students develop a secured mobile application using the MIT APP Inventor environment and test it using an android phone. The key questions being addressed are: (1) To what extent does the innovative four-week technology-oriented experience in a PBL environment followed by one semester in-school training impact minority high school students? knowledge, interest, motivation, and attitudes towards STEM-related careers? (2) In what ways does the collaborative small group experience with mentor teachers affect minority high school students? interest and awareness of STEM-related careers? (3) To what extent do the effects of the program persist after its completion? Do they lead to STEM-related post-secondary plans?  (4) What instructional and mentoring strategies can be effectively integrated in to boost minority high school students? knowledge, interest, and attitudes towards STEM-related careers? A mixed-method design with both qualitative and quantitative data will be used to examine the students' motivation and attitude towards STEM in a PBL environment.

By embedding novel software-defined sensing, computing and networking capabilities at the edge and the core of this network, researchers will be able to study, in a carefully controlled manner, real-world communications and activities on campus, in order to develop new technology for not only sensing and networking but in particular technology and policies for cyber-security, privacy and ethical use of data.<br/><br/>The POWWOW research cyberinfrastructure is unique because it integrates with OSU's large-scale production networks to support ?living lab? studies in smart sensing. Its focus on real-world sensing and device operations distinguishes POWWOW from other wireless networking testbeds that focus on communication and networking. Researchers and educators will add their own devices and systems, including diverse sensors, wireless sensor networks, software defined radios, controllers, actuators, and vehicles all of which can be dynamically instrumented. Researchers may then, privately and in real time, process data from these devices, share the data, and communicate securely with authenticated users and their devices leading to the discovery of new methods for sensing the acoustic and the radio frequency environment to get private information as well as new methods for concealing information from being sensed. The project team is uniquely composed of researchers across OSU several institutes as well as cyberinfrastructure engineers from the OSU's Office of the CIO that will translate POWWOW into sustained, production use for wide-ranging projects in research and education. Lessons learned from POWWOW will enable systems like it to be replicated in other research environments, thus greatly scaling research.<br/><br/>POWWOW will accelerate the ability of research communities across the nation to perform new types of data-driven research and education.

However, to date, relatively little attention has been paid to the implications of generative AI technologies for equity and fairness. To address this significant gap, one that could compromise the utility of this powerful technology, the North Carolina Central University School of Law (NCCU) Technology Law and Policy Center convenes the third annual Law & Technology Summit. Spanning two days with provision for both virtual and in-person participation, the Law and Technology Summit addresses the impact of generative AI on healthcare through an equity and justice lens. Related topics examined include the legal frameworks and ethical implications related to other emerging issues, such as privacy, cybersecurity, and intellectual property. This project opens with a one-day Symposium on the topic of Generative AI and Healthcare. The Symposium portion of the summit is a crucial step towards ensuring that the transformative potential of generative AI in healthcare and the broader legal profession is realized with a lens on justice, fairness, and equity. The Symposium provides a platform for a wide range of attendees from fields of technology, law, and health to dissect and debate the complex legal and ethical landscape of generative AI and healthcare, with the aim of identifying and building inclusive and ethically sound applications and approaches. Symposium papers will be published in legal journals. <br/><br/>On day two the Summit convenes a similarly diverse cohort of legal scholars and practitioners to unpack broader themes related to Artificial Intelligence and the biases inherent in AI technologies. The Summit will continue to explore the relationship between Generative AI and healthcare while examining the legal frameworks and ethical implications surrounding other emerging issues, including privacy, cybersecurity, and intellectual property. The design of the conference comprises keynote speeches, panel discussions, workshops, and roundtable sessions, all of which serve to foster dialogue among attorneys, legal scholars, sociologists, healthcare professionals, AI technologists, policymakers, ethicists, students, and others.

The approach based on the historical record that traces data from its original source to its current location (called data provenance analysis).  Securing endpoint computers is a vital component of enterprise security. Current solutions adopt a strategy for detecting attacks by comparing endpoint activity to a set of detection rules that describe common attack behaviors. However, this is an error prone practice, leading to large volumes of false alerts while failing to detect sophisticated attacks. In addition, the maintenance requirements of investigating these false alerts pose a formidable challenge within smaller to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), which lack the necessary security resources and personnel. This impediment is even more visible within SMBs housing sensitive user data, where a security breach can have profound and enduring financial and societal consequences. This technology may be used to establish data provenance analysis as a more precise and practical means of detecting attacks on endpoints. In addition, this solution may save U.S. companies millions of dollars by thwarting attacks that could have otherwise resulted in the compromise of customer data.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of analysis of data provenance to ensure cyber security. Data provenance techniques incrementally parse individual endpoint events (e.g., process executions and file accesses) into a causal dependency graph that describes the history of system execution. The graphical representation of endpoint activity highlights the relationships between objects, making it easier to identify suspicious activities. A key finding of this research is a method of overcoming the inherent architectural limitations in the machine learning models used to analyze data provenance graphs. Leveraging this method, a model was trained that comprehensively captures the typical behavior of programs by associating them with their full historical context. Attacks are detected by comparing suspicious programs to the models? expectations of each program?s behavior, which is informed by the programs? provenance. This approach significantly reduces the occurrence of false alerts when compared to current endpoint security solutions, while also eliminating the need for frequent system tuning such as the adding and removing of detection rules.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During their freshman year, Scholars will be enrolled in a special section of a first-year experience course and will be paired with upper-level peer mentors. The Scholars will have opportunities to participate in an internship or research experience. The project team will investigate the impact of the project?s student support activities, including scholarships  and peer teaching assistants, on Scholars? retention and graduation.   <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need.  To this end, the project will recruit academically talented, low-income students from a diverse base and provide them with scholarships to help them overcome financial barriers, while also addressing other barriers to success. Measurable objectives include the recruitment of two cohorts of twelve S-STEM Scholars majoring in mathematics, computer and information science, biology, data science and analytics, and cybersecurity. In addition, the project team aims to increase the first-to-second year retention rate of Scholars by 25% over baseline, and to achieve a 75% four-year graduation rate and 100% placement rate in a STEM job or STEM graduate programs six months after graduation. The project will generate new knowledge by determining the impact of teaching assistants who have been trained to enhance commuter STEM student success.  Specific measurements include impact on student engagement, persistence in a STEM major to graduation, perceived career readiness, and learner agency. The teaching assistant training and other program supports will likely contribute to improvements in academic performance, student engagement, and retention in STEM for the teaching assistants themselves, as well as the students in their classes, which include non-traditional adult students and low-income students who are not Scholars.  This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consequently, instead of striving to gain arbitrary code execution capabilities, attackers have turned their attention to the leakage of sensitive process data through memory disclosure vulnerabilities. To make matters worse, the threat of data leakage has been exacerbated by the recent spate of transient execution attacks, which can leak otherwise inaccessible process data through residual microarchitectural side effects. To defend against the emerging threat of data-oriented attacks, the project will investigate practical selective data protection techniques by focusing on i) enabling developers to protect sensitive data with minimal manual effort; ii) protecting sensitive data against both memory disclosure vulnerabilities and transient execution attacks; and iii) maintaining compatibility with large-scale real-world applications. The outcomes of the project are expected to improve the state of the art in defenses against data-oriented and transient execution attacks and achieve substantial practical impact by shielding existing vulnerable applications against exploitation, benefiting both end users and security researchers. The project will also provide students the opportunity to conduct research in cybersecurity, and will foster the integration of cybersecurity into high school education through hands-on workshops for students and seminars for science teachers.<br/><br/>To defend against the emerging threats of memory disclosure vulnerabilities and transient execution attacks, the project will investigate selective data protection techniques based on in-memory data encryption, centered around three innovative aspects. First, elevating data protection as a core language feature will enable developers to effortlessly enable in-memory encryption of data they deem critical. Besides C/C++, the project will also focus on JavaScript and Rust, which, although immune against memory disclosure vulnerabilities, are still prone to transient execution attacks. Second, a hybrid approach that combines static pointer analysis with scoped dynamic data flow tracking will minimize the heavyweight instrumentation required for keeping sensitive data encrypted in memory. The key insight behind this technique is that the inherent over-approximation of pointer analysis can be ameliorated by relying on lightweight label lookups to determine if potentially sensitive data is actually sensitive. Third, the sensitivity of pointer analysis can be increased in a scalable way by i) introducing a summarization-based context-sensitive heap modeling approach tailored to the extensive use of memory wrappers in popular applications, and ii) selectively increasing sensitivity only at certain parts of the program where it is likely to be beneficial to the overall analysis precision.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The use of autonomous ground vehicles promises to prevent more than 9 million accidents and 2 million injuries annually, conserve 7 billion liters of fuel and save more than 36,000 lives while reducing healthcare costs associated with accidents by $190 billion in the U.S. However, successful mission execution and navigation of autonomous systems rely on accurate and reliable positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) services. Current cyber-resilient PNT solutions, which rely on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), employ various techniques, such as inertial navigation systems (INS), vision-based sensing, the utilization of lower earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations or terrestrial pseudo satellites. However, they are susceptible to unintentional interference, multipath issues, atmospheric effects, segment errors, intentional interference or jamming, and spoofing.

The digital revolution that followed, based on semiconductor chips, laser communications, and computer science, has fueled the economic engine of today?s information society.  QIS will fuel a second quantum revolution into the 21st century.  The second quantum revolution will harness the full power of quantum mechanics (the physics of the atomic world) with devices that rely on quantum-weird phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to process information in ways that are much more powerful than today?s best supercomputers and cybersecurity systems. The Focused Research Hub in Theoretical Physics (FRHTP):  Center for Quantum Information and Control (CQuIC) funded in this grant from the NSF will create a ?theory hub? for fundamental research that provides the foundation for the second quantum revolution.  Housed at the University of New Mexico (UNM), CQuIC brings together an interdisciplinary team of theoreticians with expertise in physics, computer science, electrical engineering, and chemistry, as well as partners at Sandia National Laboratories, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Honeywell Quantum Solutions, to collaborate, innovate, and tackle the most important outstanding problems in QIS.  CQuIC will provide a focal point for United States QIS-theory community to retain its competitive advantage.  CQuIC will serve the National Quantum Initiative (NQI) Act by hosting focused workshops that target common problems, share lessons learned, and help to break logjams when they arise to push forward the goals of the NQI.  The hub will be critical for education and training, with a focus on building a diverse and inclusive next-generation QIS workforce.<br/><br/>To achieve these goals, CQuIC will administer a prize postdoctoral fellowship program, host seminars, workshops, conferences, and a visitor?s program, and critically focus on synergistic research that brings together the principal investigators at UNM with its partnering institutions.  The research will be anchored in tackling four ?Big Questions? in contemporary QIS:  I. What is the computational power of quantum matter?  II. How do we efficiently represent quantum systems, and when do these representations lead to efficient classical algorithms?  III. What quantum advantage can be achieved with Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices?  IV. What near-term quantum algorithms and architectures can yield practical results?  Postdoctoral fellows will provide the ?connective tissue,? creating bridges between senior participants and bringing additional expertise to the Center. CQuIC?s intensely collaborative environment will provide the necessary incubator for the QIS-theory community to work to together to tackle the Big Questions.  In addition, CQuIC will host a variety of hub activities that will bring together the community to interact, create, and tackle critical problems, and integrate this with education, training, and shared educational resources to help develop the next generation of quantum information scientists.  Hub activities include the long-running SQuInT Annual Workshop, with a 25-year history of focus on building community for early-career scientists at a world-class conference.

Since quantum computers will be capable of breaking all the main cryptosystems we are heavily relying on today, it is necessary to develop new cryptosystems that are quantum-resistant, and the National Institute of Standard of Technology is the process to develop the post-quantum cryptographic standards.  Lattice-based cryptography represents one of the most promising families of such quantum-resistant cryptosystems. However, despite its successes so far, there has been a severe lack of understanding as to how the basic components of lattice-based cryptography, namely lattices and reduction algorithms, operate. This knowledge gap is harmful in a number of ways, such as the compromise of the performance of lattice-based systems, the inaccurate and unreliable evaluation of their security, and even the potential threat to the very idea of lattice-based cryptography itself. The goal of the present proposal is to confront these problems by developing a solid theoretical foundation for lattice-based cryptography. Our theory will be applied systematically to improve the practice of lattice-based cryptography and to scientifically assess the security of lattice-based systems, thereby contributing to humanity's effort to prepare for the quantum era.<br/><br/>This project largely consists of two parts that will be combined into one for a complete analysis of lattice reduction algorithms. First, the project will refine the number-theoretic tools used to study the statistics of lattice vectors. This was originally pioneered by the works of Siegel, Schmidt, and Rogers in the 1940-50's, but the current practice of lattice-based cryptography calls for the extensions of those tools to broader contexts, so as to be able to handle lattices defined over a general number field, or count sublattices of lesser rank rather than just lattice vectors. They will serve to replace the Gaussian heuristic in order to provide more accurate predictions of lattice behavior. Second, recently the PIs found that lattice reduction algorithms may be interpreted as sandpile models from statistical physics, and these two systems of very different origins behave in a remarkably similar way. This provides an exciting and promising approach to a scientific study of reduction algorithms, which is exactly what this project will pursue: apply the physical theory of sandpiles to reduction algorithms. Once this project establishes the explanatory and predictive power of both sets of results, the project will apply them to revising the security estimates of lattice-based cryptosystems and the current practices in parameter choices, in particular, for the lattice-based cryptosystems in the ongoing NIST post-quantum standardization process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The core problem when operating through non-cooperative commercial 5G infrastructure is that the unknown infrastructure potentially exposes communications to an adversary. Traversing adversary-controlled infrastructure allows DOD?s adversaries to recognize, disrupt, or extract intelligence even from encrypted communications. Increasingly complex obfuscation techniques have created an arms race against network intelligence techniques to detect the obfuscation. With each new obfuscation, DOD can never know if it fools the adversary, or if the adversary is simply lulling DOD into a false sense of security.The next great capability leap for operating through 5G networks will likely come from sophisticated analytics that provide situational awareness of threats within the communications infrastructure, and an implementation that dynamically routes communications along benign paths. Through a team that combines expertise across disciplines and sectors, this project will pursue this transformative capability and accelerate convergence on a new DOD 5G defense: restructuring communication paths to avoid adversary-controlled base stations, networks, and locations, thereby keeping DOD communications unobservable by the adversary.<br/> This project proposes a system?Automated Verification Of Internet Data-paths (AVOID)?that creates this unprecedented capability through two deliverables that tackle two high risk attack vectors for 5G communications. Deliverable 1 targets the potential for adversaries to control commercial base stations anywhere in the world, allowing them to subvert DOD communications at the point of entry intro the wireless network. AVOID will recognize malicious and surveillance base stations, and provide a mechanism for DOD devices to connect to specific benign base stations. Deliverable 2 combats the ability of our adversaries to apply sophisticated and complex network analytics to any DOD communications that traverse networks or territory they control. AVOID will embed topologic and geographic awareness into a routing system, and provide a mechanism for DOD?s communications to avoid adversary-controlled territory across the global Internet and provide safe paths to DOD-controlled networks. Combined, these deliverables will provide end-to-end adversary avoidance without requiring modification to existing applications or routers in DOD networks, or cooperation by any third-party network.The intellectual merit comes from addressing a persistently unsolved national security challenge which requires convergence across seven areas of expertise: 5G communication and network management; Internet path analytics; overlay routing; operational network security; test and evaluation that targets DOD scenarios; technology transition; and professional project management. AVOID 5G will also broadly impact society. The deliverables complement the broader landscape of zero-trust architectures, secure 5G implementations, and ongoing obfuscation technique development.

As such, they are also major targets for cyberattacks, such as malware. It is critical to teach software security topics on the latest Windows versions. However, there are currently no systematic advanced software security education modules for the latest Windows system. The goal of this project is to develop advanced teaching modules on software security, particularly memory corruption attack and defense for the latest systems. A memory corruption attack triggers memory errors through malicious and delicate inputs and is often part of an advanced cyberattack. The developed teaching modules will help students understand how various security features of Windows compilers and linkers are used to fight against miscellaneous memory corruption attacks and their limitations. This will help prepare students for real-world bug hunting and software security.<br/><br/>This project will achieve six objectives. 1. Innovating Armitage, an open-source graphical user interface front end of Metasploit, which is a tool used to identify security vulnerabilities. Armitage is an ideal open-source tool to demonstrate attacks and raise security awareness given its ease of use. 2. Developing defense modules on Exploit Protection features of the latest Windows. 3. Incorporating a variety of memory corruption vulnerabilities into a vulnerable chat server (VChat), which will be developed as a Visual C++ project, and developing corresponding attack teaching materials in Python. 4. Developing Metasploit modules in Ruby for all memory corruption attacks, which can be used with Armitage. The purpose of Metasploit modules is to demonstrate those attacks easily and motivate students to learn the principles. 5. Integrating developed teaching modules into related courses at the two participating institutions, University of Massachusetts Lowell and University of Central Florida. 6. Disseminating developed teaching modules, software and systems through a faculty development workshop, project websites, GitHub repositories, video tutorials, CLARK (a cybersecurity curriculum hosting platform), academic publications, and field trips as outreach venues to K-12 students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The security of the Internet infrastructure is a high priority for the security research community, but that community is greatly hindered by a lack of relevant data.  The goal of this project is a validated design for a transformative infrastructure to support collection, curation, archiving, and expanded sharing of data needed to advance critical and stunted scientific research on the security, stability, and resilience of Internet infrastructure.<br/><br/>The measurement infrastructure design effort will focus on the Internet transport layer: routing, domain naming, addressing, and key management (the Certificate Authorities).  Community workshops and interactive prototyping efforts will enable evaluation of a proposed design of a measurement infrastructure to acquire and share such security-relevant data at a macroscopic scale.  Due to the complexity, volume, and sensitivity of resulting data, the design will cover many facets of data management: curation, post-processing analytics, privacy preserving data analysis frameworks, data discovery and accessibility, and normalized data sharing agreements. To support use of and feedback on prototypes, the PIs will develop an on-line course on Network Infrastructure Data Science, that will facilitate responsible (ethical, privacy-respecting) use of the datasets and analytics, and STEM/cybersecurity workforce training. This design project will enable the application of data-intensive methods to data from the global Internet infrastructure, overcoming a key barrier to scientific and engineering advances to navigate current and future Internet-related harms. The project will contribute to a broad range of disciplines that now depend on data about the Internet, including network science, socioeconomic studies, international relations, and political science.

The university will partner with two regional community colleges, Montgomery College and Frederick Community College, to strengthen the transfer process and promote transfer student success.  Over its five-year duration, the project will provide two-year scholarships to 27 transfer students, in three cohorts.  The Scholars will pursue bachelor?s degrees in biochemistry, biology, chemistry, computer science, cybersecurity, environmental science, and/or mathematics.  Community college and university faculty will collaborate to recruit and advise all students interested in transferring to a four-year institution. Upon acceptance in the fall of their second year at the community college, students will receive extensive pre-transfer support and some will be selected to receive scholarships.  At the university, all transfer students will benefit from supports designed to promote retention and graduation of STEM students. As a result, the project has the potential for impact well beyond the 27 Scholars.  The project will educate faculty about inclusive pedagogy to help promote academic achievement of diverse students. Evaluation of the project?s activities will advance understanding of effective strategies for supporting recruitment, retention, and success of community college transfer students in STEM. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. Mount St. Mary?s University will partner with Frederick Community College and Montgomery College to implement the Transfer Pathways Program, an enhanced recruiting program designed to increase transfer capital. Students accepted into the university will receive extensive pre-transfer support designed to further increase transfer capital and facilitate their transition.  Upon matriculation to the university, they will receive academic, social, and professional development support designed to promote retention and graduation. Selected students will also receive scholarships.  The intended measurable outcomes of this project are: 1) To recruit and financially support 27 Pell-eligible STEM students from Montgomery College and Frederick Community College; 2) To retain 90% of the Scholars through graduation; 3) To place 90% of Scholars in graduate school or professional roles in their STEM field within one year of graduation; 4) To determine the effectiveness of the institutional partnership on promoting enrollment, transfer capital, and engagement of academically talented, low-income STEM community college transfer students. Because much of the research examining transfer student success has involved large, public institutions, it is important to understand how institutional partnerships between community colleges and small private universities can promote transfer capital, student engagement, and student success. Measures of these variables will be compared pre- and post-participation in the Transfer Pathways program and between community college students who participated in Transfer Pathways and those who did not. Through publications and conference presentations, the partnering institutions will widely disseminate research and evaluation results. This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project's broader significance and importance is in addressing the urgent need of the cloud computing industry to mitigate the impact of cyberattacks and to protect the privacy of users, which is aligned with the mission of the National Science Foundation.<br/> <br/>The key observation in this project is that data are immune to leakage threats as long as they remain encrypted at all times, including during processing. Towards that end, the investigator employs a special form of encryption, called Fully Homomorphic Encryption, to protect general-purpose computation using diverse hardware platforms such as graphics processing units. Specifically, this project defines imperative models of computation that improve the programmability of encrypted data processing, without sacrificing execution performance. These models are complemented with real-life applications such as privacy-preserving machine learning and data mining that harness the power of encrypted computation. The results of this project are integrated with educational activities, including web-based learning environments and cybersecurity competitions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Artificial intelligence (AI)-based conversational agents have great potential to improve digital literacy and cyber safety education because they can provide personalized, dynamic, and immediate learning guidance and feedback. The goal of this research is to educate teens on safe, responsible, and ethical conduct on the internet through Social Media Co-Pilot, an innovative AI-based conversational intervention embedded in an interactive and realistic online learning environment. By dynamically analyzing learners? input, the Co-Pilot will identify ?teachable moments? and offer personalized, conversational feedback to reinforce prosocial behaviors and discourage risky actions online. With the capacity to assume different conversational roles appropriate to the situation (e.g., a more knowledgeable peer, a peer needing immediate help, an adult mentor etc.), Social Media Co-Pilot will guide a learner into a deeper reflection and responsible actions when confronting common social media risks and pitfalls, such as online aggression, privacy violation, phishing, and scams. This project will benefit all youth, but will provide additional, customized support to vulnerable and underserved communities, thus reducing digital divides. Youth?s improved digital literacy and cyber safety skills can provide a foundation for STEM literacy and enhance their readiness to pursue STEM careers. <br/><br/>The PIs will employ cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) techniques to develop the conversational agent that drives Social Media Co-Pilot. They will iteratively refine Social Media Co-Pilot with teens and educators, whose formative feedback will inform incremental improvement of the tool and provide personalized in-situ conversations and critical reflection on various cybersecurity challenges. Co-Pilot will be developed using large language models with extensive input from racially and ethnically diverse teens and educators to ensure its relevance to different learners, as well as its effectiveness and scalability. Once built, PIs will evaluate the effects of Social Media Co-Pilot on youth?s cyber safety knowledge and behavioral outcomes through a randomized field experiment. By leveraging educational theories to inform improvements in the design and evaluation of Social Media Co-Pilot, this project will contribute new knowledge about the effectiveness of AI-based conversational agents as experiential learning tools. It will also advance the understanding of human-centered AI design and novel ways to customize large scale NLP models in the education domain, while ensuring reliability, transparency, and fairness in design and application.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Network data appear prominently in many scientific domains such as ecology (food webs), sociology (social networks), biology (protein-protein interactions), telecommunications, and cybersecurity (cellular and computer networks).  This project addresses two important inference problems in network science. The first is to quantify the similarities between a collection of networks for the purpose of classifying a network into categories such as being typical or anomalous. The second is dimension reduction for large and complex networks; this is essential in the development of memory and computationally efficient algorithms for analyzing network data. The investigator will complement theoretical and methodological investigations by developing open-source software packages for network analysis, and mentoring graduate students in statistics and data science.<br/><br/>The research program has three main aims. The first is to study efficient parameters estimation for latent position graphs. Given a latent position graph, the investigator will derive both uniform error bounds and normal approximations for its estimated latent positions. The second aim is to develop valid and robust two-sample testing procedures for latent position graphs with a particular emphasis on the setting where the link function is an unknown radial function. Combining these two aims allows practitioners to compare graphs while ignoring irrelevant features such as difference in edge densities or nodes relabeling in real data. The third aim is to conduct perturbation analysis of randomized singular value decomposition (RSVD) when used for dimension reduction of large, noisy graphs. Viewing the observed adjacency matrix as arising from a general ?signal-plus-noise? framework, the investigator will derive upper bounds for the spectral and two-to-infinity-norm distances between the approximate singular vectors of the observed matrix and the true singular vectors of the signal matrix. These upper bounds will depend on the signal-to-noise ratio and the number of power iterations. Finally, as part of this third aim the investigator will also derive uniform entrywise approximation for recovery of a low-rank signal matrix using RSVD. Results established under this third aim can be applied to general matrix-valued data beyond graphs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The regional training is designed to address skills and knowledge gaps to accelerate and sustain deep technology ventures across the region. The Hub leverages a diverse, pooled network of mentors and industry experts to reduce time and risk in the creation of new ventures. Also, the Hub is responsive to securing national defense, building on NSF?s investments in cybersecurity, novel materials, and advanced analytics,  by specifically identifying, addressing, and supporting dual-use technologies.<br/><br/>This I-Corps Desert and Pacific Region Hub project is based on the development of a network that advances and deepens the regenerative innovation capacity of the partnering institutions, providing meaningful experiential development opportunities for faculty, researchers, students, and collaborators through direct entrepreneurial engagements and skills development. The Hub facilitates intentional group learning through a deeply networked community of practice, including I-Corps instructors, mentors, administrators, faculty, and students ideally positioned to collectively support the academic community in translating research into deep technology ventures, regardless of location.  The Hub also seeks to diminish disadvantages, such as the lack of mature assets equal to those in historically advantaged and resource-rich locales.  This Hub provides quality and flexibility, while enabling participating institutions to incorporate structured entrepreneurial training and support in a proven online method. Building on a body of scholarship, a network focused on developing the entrepreneurial mindset, additive and agile innovation, curricular adaptations, organizational and infrastructure support including distributed mentor models and shared customer databases, and the utilization of innovative tools, the Hub advances entrepreneurial programming and research to inform I-Corps practice, illuminate national trends, and influence organizational and national policy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, ML is also susceptible to adversaries who can attack both the data models are trained on and the ML models themselves. This can lead to poor behavior in the models and poor decisions in the people who use them. This project?s goal is to advance our ability to detect and respond to attacks through focusing on provenance: systematic capture of the data and training methods used in building models, along with the inference processes and decisions made after they are deployed. By capturing these data and developing methods to use the data when assessing risks, auditing models, and forensically analyzing incidents, the work will make ML systems both more robust and more accountable around attacks. These capabilities will in turn benefit organizations that develop and use ML models, along with policymakers and regulators who oversee their effects. <br/><br/>The work is organized into three main thrusts. The first thrust focuses on systematic capture and characterization of pre-deployment (training) and post-deployment (inference) provenance, focusing on what constitutes training and inference provenance and the innate nondeterminism of ML computations. In particular, training and inference metadata, training progression, inference computation dynamics, and per-label characterization approaches will be explored. The second thrust will use these data for provenance-driven detection of training data poisoning and model evasion across a range of threat models and application domains. For poisoning detection, both similarity-based and distribution shift detection-based approaches will be pursued while for evasion detection, inference provenance will be analyzed empirically and structurally. The third thrust focuses on developing post-compromise forensics capabilities with the goal of tracing back attacks to their cause(s) and mitigating future attacks. Integrated with these three thrusts is an educational plan that includes developing new courses on ML trustworthiness for undergraduate and graduate students, robust ML-focused ethical hacking competitions for undergraduates, and K-12 summer camps on robust ML to develop and diversify the next generation of cybersecurity workers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

DOCC is a digital Project Room that enables domain scientists and computer scientists to collaborate on real-world problems by providing them with high-performance computing, high-resolution displays, and sophisticated Artificial Intelligence (AI), data analytic, data simulation, image processing, visualization, and virtual-reality software and services. <br/><br/>Societal challenges can only be addressed by research teams, with each contributing expertise in complementary areas. DOCC?s Intellectual Merit is two-fold: it provides onsite computing with adequate support, and it provides collaboration software services. With respect to the former, DOCC is a configurable computing environment that prioritizes real-time, interactive, collaborative, data-intensive applications, but can be scheduled off-hours for batch-mode processing. Users can execute codes faster, apply more sophisticated analytics to large-scale problems, gain greater insights, and open new avenues of research. With respect to the latter, DOCC?s collaboration software lets researchers either sit around one of DOCC?s large tables and display walls or video-teleconference in while simultaneously sharing and interacting with their data on the large displays ? which remote viewers can access online.<br/><br/>To encourage adoption and ensure Broader Impact, DOCC plans to have a visual front end, enabling users to easily access familiar collaboration tools, scientific notebooks, AI workflows, and popular visualization software. Alternatively, users can add new AI models or create them from scratch. And because DOCC is connected to the UIC research network, data and/or computer codes can be ported to remote computer and cloud resources located on campus, regionally, nationally, or internationally. DOCC personnel can assist new users make their applications more robust, dynamic and configurable. DOCC can transform scientific research, data exploration and discovery, recruit and retain new faculty, make cyberinfrastructure more accessible to students, and help educate the next-generation workforce. UIC is a Minority Serving Institution, a Hispanic Serving Institution and an Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institution.<br/><br/>DOCC and its associated data will remain active for at least three years after the completion of this project, as demand dictates.

When computational scientists execute their applications on NISQ machines, they receive erroneous and noisy program outputs. The promise of exponential speedups by quantum computers is not meaningful if the end-users cannot infer the correct program output after executing their programs on these machines. Therefore, this project, Qurious (pronounced as ""curious""), aims to design and develop a robust system software ecosystem for quantum computers to help quantum programmers make meaningful interpretations of noisy and erroneous runs on quantum computers. The methods, developed in this project, will mitigate the side-effects of errors on quantum computers, and hence, enable high-performance computing (HPC) programmers to leverage quantum computers for solving computationally challenging problems of societal importance. This project will help HPC programmers scale their programs on larger quantum machines, and exploit the heterogeneity among quantum machines in terms of resilience characteristics on quantum cloud computing platforms, to make program outputs less noisy and more reliable. <br/><br/>This project aims to prepare a diverse and competitive STEM workforce with quantum computing skills to achieve economic competitiveness in the quantum-enabled future and leverage the transformative changes quantum computing will bring to society. This project devises a novel three-pronged education and outreach plan. The first step aims to raise curiosity and elevate excitement about quantum computing at an early stage (e.g., high school students). Then, at the next stage (i.e., undergraduate level), this excitement is converted into the development of quantum-style thinking.

This Partnership Development and Planning project brings together STEM educational researchers, STEM professionals, community organizers, and caregivers. Together they will work toward research that explores rightful presence for Black girls and their caregivers in the context of multigenerational informal STEM learning, particularly around emerging technologies. Educational researchers, from Old Dominion University and Indiana University-Indianapolis will deepen and extend an existing research-practice partnership to include Community-Based Organizations (CBOs), STEM professionals, and caregivers. Butterfly Village (Hampton Road, VA) and Girls STEM Institute (Indianapolis, IN) are CBOs that offer holistic programming intentionally designed to support Black girls' intersectional identities. These CBOs engage Black girls in the relevancy of STEM knowledge and skills and emphasize the importance of real-world applications via Connected Learning Theory. Both CBOs provide counterspaces?spaces that foster community and are created by and for people who experience oppression. In these counterspaces girls voluntarily work on collaborative projects, join in group discussions, and engage in STEM learning through social interaction. As community organizers, a future goal for these CBOs is to support the utilization of emerging technologies (e.g., AI, data science, cybersecurity) to connect learning activities to real issues. Based on this goal, STEM professionals from local organizations?Drone Force Indiana and Virginia Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation Center?with expertise in digital transformation technologies join this partnership to ensure their needs and perspectives are included in the framing of the future research project. Both CBOs were intentionally designed for the girl participants and are redesigning after noting the interest in STEM learning experiences among caregivers (via observations and direct feedback). By establishing a research-practice collaborative all partners will share in contributing to the framing of their future work together, including research questions, learning design, methodology design, intended goals, and outcomes of future multigenerational informal STEM counterspaces. <br/> <br/><br/>Partnership development processes are grounded in two theoretical frameworks: Rightful Presence and Community Cultural Wealth. The tenets of rightful presence will support partners in developing trust where each recognizes differences in cultural backgrounds, race, and power while also acknowledging possible tensions that may arise due to these differences. Using the Community Cultural Wealth framework, partners will explore the various forms of capital brought to the research practice collaborative, such aspirational capital where the collaborative envisions what this partnership can accomplish together for the future of Black girls and their caregivers. Key activities grounded in these frameworks include sharing personal perspectives and cultural artifacts while developing shared norms for working together; mind mapping and visualizing to identify goals, areas for collaboration, and milestones; meeting co-design and consensus building; roundtable discussions, feedback, and reflections; and closing commitment circles to commit to next steps, roles, and collaboration activities. Through these activities, the team will answer preliminary questions such as: How can a partnership between caregivers, community spaces, STEM experts, and researchers be effectively established? What are the barriers and facilitators to collaboration between partners? How can a research practice collaborative in partnership with researchers, caregivers, community members, and STEM professionals design a study of informal STEM learning spaces that facilitate positive change for Black girls and their caregivers? Culturally Responsive Evaluation will provide formative feedback on processes, strategy, and honoring of each partners? community, capital, and perspectives. Summative evaluation will emerge though co-facilitated visioning sessions to establish anticipated and unanticipated outcomes of the partnership processes that will be shared with the broader informal STEM learning field. <br/><br/>This Partnership Development and Planning project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.

It is vital to ensure that different users of web applications are only allowed to access what they are supposed to, i.e., implementing correct authorization. But, unfortunately, broken access control and authorization has been constantly ranked as one of the top web application vulnerabilities. In fact, many web applications cannot provide an accurate specification of their enforced authorization policies due to challenges such as code complexity and fast-paced development. Neither end users nor even developers of the applications could reason about data protection in this environment. To address this problem, this research project devises a novel framework for learning fine-grained authorization policies from web applications without relying on access to their source codes or understanding other internal complexities. The project develops an integrated research and education program to train the next generation of cybersecurity workforce at the intersection of security/privacy, machine learning, and web technologies. Since web-based systems are pervasive in our society, the developed framework and associated solutions will significantly contribute to system safety and user privacy. Furthermore, due to their black-box design, the developed techniques will be critical assets to investigate data authorization practices of applications outside their development environments by application adopters (e.g., companies deploying outsourced applications) and third parties acting in the interest of end users (e.g., security/privacy researchers and regulators investigating compliance with privacy laws and expectations). The project engages a diverse body of students especially from underrepresented groups in security and privacy research and exposes the broad community to security and privacy topics through outreach activities.<br/><br/>This research project develops a novel paradigm for automated learning of web application authorization policies that significantly improves ensuring the security and privacy of web applications. A key characteristic of this research is to treat web applications as black boxes, i.e., learning authorizations by interacting with and observing them as would regular end users. The black-box approach allows abstracting away internal complexities of web applications and focusing instead on what matters: learning what policies are enforced on users as they access application data. The research is carried out in three thrusts. First, a theoretical policy learning framework will be devised for efficiently probing the authorization space of applications as black boxes and constructing formal specifications of their policies. Second, a methodology and associated techniques for learning representation of data objects, relationships, and operations from black-box web applications will be developed in order to realize practical deployment of the theoretical framework in the web domain. Third, the project will develop techniques for analysis and integration of the learned authorization policies to improve the security and privacy of web applications. This paradigm will be transformative for web security/privacy research and practice by providing researchers, developers, and analysts an automated approach to learn the specifications of authorization policies. In addition to enabling them to understand the authorization behavior of web applications, it will revitalize research in formal policy testing and verification techniques that rely on concrete policy specifications. Furthermore, the general framework will be applicable beyond web applications to other domains such as mobile app ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Popular smart devices include watches, doorbells, cameras, locks, televisions, and speakers. Smart devices offer better ways of living, working, playing, creating, and caring for others. But they also introduce privacy concerns, security vulnerabilities, and potentials for unfair and opaque uses. For example, people may use smart security cameras to surveil and monitor the activities of neighbors, domestic workers, passersby, and other household members. Smart devices with spatial sensing capabilities--such as microphones, cameras, and location tracking--may identify and track people nearby. Non-primary users, such as guests, roommates, and delivery drivers, may interact with smart devices, but with limited awareness, consent, and control. This project will study how primary and non-primary users interact with smart devices, and each other, to better understand their concerns and preferences. Findings will be used to develop prototypes for new products and interfaces to improve privacy for non-primary users. Insights from these prototypes will be generalized into design recommendations for practitioners and educators. The project will also address design tradeoffs and stakeholder conflicts that demand policy and strategy responses beyond purely technological solutions. The education plan incorporates digital privacy, cybersecurity, and data ethics into design and human-computer interaction education and outreach activities.<br/><br/>This research will apply interdisciplinary design processes to develop design prototypes, patterns, and principles for improving human-centered data privacy, security, and interrelated ethical concerns, including trust, transparency, and fairness. Design principles are practice-based heuristics or guidelines used to understand design problems and to make and explain design decisions. Design patterns are generalized solutions to recurring design problems. They are commonly used across many fields of design and software engineering. Fieldwork will be conducted to understand the practices and preferences of diverse stakeholders with a focus on non-primary users of smart devices. Empirical results will inform the design, development, deployment, and analysis of novel prototypes corresponding to design patterns. This research will contribute to a long-term research program integrating design, engineering, and privacy/security expertise to promote positive social change and ethical research and practice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Key barriers to equity and inclusion in STEM commercialization and entrepreneurship include systemic cultural perceptions, training and reward structures, and patenting/ technology transfer activities at academic institutions. It is important to recognize and redress these inequities, not only as a matter of fairness but also because the lack of diversity in entrepreneurship diminishes the diversity of new ideas and hurts US technological innovation and economic competitiveness. To achieve systemic change in this area, the project will leverage a robust partnership of organizations across the state of New Jersey. The NJECC will be led by New Jersey Institute of Technology in collaboration with the NJ Commission on Science, Innovation and Technology; NJEdge (NJ?s non-profit technology services provider and member-driven consortium); New Jersey City University; Princeton University; Rowan University; Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey; Seton Hall University; Stevens Institute of Technology; and St. Peters University. Working together, the NJECC project partners will aim to significantly increase the diversity of STEM faculty researchers who participate in New Jersey?s entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystem. In turn, developing innovation pathways for new and diverse innovators will foster economic growth and the availability of new products and services that are important to society.<br/> <br/>The NJECC project will include two main initiatives: (1) training for Gatekeepers (academic Tech Transfer, Venture Development and Entrepreneurial offices) on methods to reduce barriers that hinder the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in commercialization activities and (2) the establishment of NJ statewide inclusive network development programs (showcases and conferences). In addition, NJECC will link these planned activities with the NJIT NSF-funded CyberCorps @ Scholarship for Service grant, the Secure Computing Initiative, to increase diversity and innovation in the crucial area of cybersecurity. Over the course of the project, these initiatives will aim to generate sustainable, intentional strategies for increasing the diversity of the academic innovator pool?strategies that then can be institutionalized across the state and beyond. The NJECC will aim to significantly reduce key barriers to equity and inclusion in STEM commercialization and entrepreneurship and will significantly increase the diversity of NJ STEM faculty researchers who participate in New Jersey?s entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystem. The collaboration will also extend the existing infrastructures and resources of the less-resourced institutions through access to the resources of the other participating institutions. In addition, this project will aim to stimulate the ongoing collection of patenting and invention disclosure data, disaggregated by gender, race/ethnicity, and other identity dimensions. The NJECC team will use a variety of channels to disseminate project findings and strategies for systemic change, including but not limited to 1) print, digital, and social media; 2) national/regional conference presentations (NSF events, AUTM, UEDA, EdgeCon) and 3) relevant academic journals and resource libraries (TechTransfer Tactics, ARC Network).<br/><br/>The NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.?

With the proposed system, the PERs will be capable of collaboratively providing reliable electricity services to their host grids under extreme weather-induced events. The system will also enable the PERs to self-detect cyber-attacks, and to take corrective actions. The above features will be achieved by explicitly modeling, monitoring, and controlling the interactions between PERs and their host grid in the energy space, and by watermarking their measurements via local renewable and load fluctuations. The intellectual merits include the following: 1) the project conceptualizes for the first time the co-design of cyber and physical resilient solutions for networked PERs in the energy space where the complexity of PER dynamics exhibited in a conventional space can be significantly reduced; 2) the proposed cyber-attack detector can differentiate cyber-attacks from large physical disturbances; 3) the microgrid simulation platform will be the first-of-its-kind, open-source, hardware-verified platform that will accelerate the innovation of clean energy technologies. The broader impacts include the following: 1) the project will catalyze the adoption of clean energy, and contribute towards improving energy equity by enabling PERs to power their distribution systems under extreme weather conditions. Disadvantaged communities who cannot afford their own solar panels or energy storage can enjoy reliable electricity services by this mechanism during extreme weather conditions; 2) it will educate the workforce, especially in Hispanic communities, by enriching power system education with topics on cyber resilience. It will also grow a talent pipeline by organizing Renewable Energy and Cybersecurity Summer Camps for K12 students.<br/><br/>The project will be carried out in terms of three thrusts. Thrust 1 will conceptualize a system-aware, resilient controller for PERs.

Rapid growth in human population and its ability to adapt to a variety of environmental conditions has resulted in unprecedented levels of interaction between humans and other species. This rise in interaction combined with emerging trends in globalization, anti-microbial resistance, urbanization, climate change, and ecological pressures has increased the risk of a global pandemic. Computation and data sciences can capture the complexities underlying these disease determinants and revolutionize real-time epidemiology --- leading to fundamentally new ways to reduce the global burden of infectious diseases that has plagued humanity for thousands of years. This Expeditions project will enable novel implementations of global infectious disease computational epidemiology by advancing computational foundations, engineering principles, theoretical understanding, and novel technologies. The innovative tools developed will provide new analytical capabilities to decision makers and result in improved science-based decision making for epidemic planning and response. They will facilitate enhanced inter-agency and inter-government coordination and outbreak response. The team will work closely with many local, regional, national, and international public health agencies and universities to apply and deploy powerful technologies during epidemic outbreaks that can be expected to occur during the course of the project. International scientific networks linked to a comprehensive postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate student training program will be established. Educational programs to foster interest in and increase understanding of computational science in addressing the complex societal challenges due to pandemics will also be developed. The team, with partners in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America, will produce multidisciplinary scientists with diverse skills related to public health.  <br/><br/>The novel implementations of this project will be enabled by the development of a rigorous computational theory of spreading and control processes on dynamic multi-scale, multi-layer (MSML) networks, along with tools from AI, machine learning, and social sciences. New techniques resulting from this research will make it possible to develop and apply large-scale simulations of epidemics and social interactions over MSML networks. These simulations, in turn, will provide fundamentally new insights into how to control epidemics. Pervasive computing technologies will be developed to support disease surveillance and real-time response.  The computational advances will also be generalizable; that is, they will be applicable to other areas such as cybersecurity, ecology, economics and social sciences. The project will take into account emerging concerns and constraints that include: preserving privacy of individuals and vulnerable groups, enabling model predictions to be interpreted and explained, developing effective interventions under uncertain and unknown network data, understanding strategic and adversarial behaviors of individual agents, and ensuring fairness of the process across the entire population.

Encryption by itself, however, does not guarantee people?s privacy, accountability, and safety. Sometimes safety goals require plausible deniability: for conversations that might be compromising, it can useful to send a message and have the receiver know who sent it, but not be able to prove who the sender was to others. Sometimes accountability goals require non-repudiation: for on-the-record conversations, a sender may want to be able to prove that they, or their partner, sent a message even if the partner claims otherwise and tries to alter the conversation transcript. This project?s goal is to help people understand and make good choices about when to choose deniability and when to choose non-repudiation and develop messaging app features that make it easy to make those choices. Through this, the project will advance knowledge around how people make sense of and use cryptography, and people?s practical ability to effectively and safely communicate.<br/> <br/>The project is organized around two parallel interface design activities, one focused on interfaces for deniability, and one on interfaces for non-repudiation.  For deniability, the team will develop interaction techniques that allow users to alter the content, timing, and authorship of messages in a transcript, leveraging underlying cryptographic techniques that support those edits. For non-repudiation, the team will develop interaction techniques that help people cryptographically sign messages using keys tied to their identity. Both interfaces will be tested through a series of user studies that address (1) people?s ability to use the tools, (2) their ability to understand the implications of using tools for deniability and non-repudiation, and (3) to use them in conversational contexts.

However, the growth of wireless cyberspace has also led to an increase in security threats and actual attacks. As a result, research and development on wireless security have become a focus across academic, government, and industry sectors. Proactive and autonomous defenses have emerged as promising countermeasures, but research in extremely complex wireless networks and spectrum access security remains under-explored. The workshop?s novelty is its aim to fill the research gap by providing a vibrant forum for multi-disciplinary leading researchers and practitioners to discuss critical cyber threats facing complex wireless systems and spectrum security and to propose countermeasures leveraging new concepts such as enhanced wireless situational awareness. The workshop's broader significance and importance lie in its potential to help the research community better understand the need for securing wireless communications and spectrum access, and to propose proactive and autonomous defenses in wireless networks operating in challenging environments or even contested space for DoD applications.<br/><br/>The workshop's technical sessions are organized around different aspects of leveraging software-defined radios (SDRs) for spectrum/waveform-aware wireless security designs. The progress in SDR technology and the rise of collaborative and opportunistic access to the limited radio frequency (RF) spectrum have opened opportunities for both wireless system defenders and attackers. Attackers can exploit SDR devices to devise optimal attack strategies, while defenders will try best to identify attacked spectrum bands and adversarial waveforms to secure subsequent transmissions. Both sides can harness recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to intensify the battle in the intricate wireless cyberspace. The workshop will be attended by renowned researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government agencies, spanning various fields such as cybersecurity, wireless communications and networking, information theory, IoT systems, AI and machine learning, communication software-hardware co-design, and fog/edge computing.

ML, especially deep learning that uses deep neural networks, has made remarkable breakthroughs in various research domains and disciplines including computer vision, natural language processing, biology, and math, to name a few. However, in the past decade, extensive work has shown ML models are vulnerable to privacy and security attacks. For example, email spam filters can be compromised by data poisoning attacks, where attackers confuse ML models by feeding them bogus data, allowing adversaries to send malicious emails containing malware or other security threats without being noticed. Attackers can also make repeated requests to models, looking at the results in order to reconstruct the data used to build ML models; in health domains, for instance, successful data reconstruction attacks might expose private medical details about patients. Many defense methods have been proposed to mitigate these attacks, but they face several limitations: they often aren?t effective in real-world applications with strict confidentiality requirements, or unacceptably degrade the performance of the models. Further, most defenses are aimed at particular learning methods or attack types, making it hard to deal with multiple concurrent attacks, and generalizing poorly to different types of models and data. This project?s goal is to address these limitations by designing a trustworthy learning framework based on information theory. The outcomes of the project will advance the state-of-the-art trustworthy ML and information-theoretic approaches to privacy, while contributing to the growing national need for professionals in ML and cybersecurity.<br/><br/>To do this, the team will design a practical, accurate, flexible, and generalizable information-theoretic trustworthy representation learning framework with robustness and privacy guarantees. The work will be structured around three thrusts. Thrust 1 will design novel information-theoretic representation learning methods against common privacy attacks, including membership inference, property inference, and data reconstruction attacks. Thrust 2 will design novel information-theoretic representation learning methods against common security attacks, including test-time evasion attacks, training-time poisoning attacks, and training- and test-time backdoor attacks. Thrust 3 will generalize Thrust 1 and Thrust 2 to handle diverse attack types (e.g., multiple privacy/security attacks or their combination), data types (e.g., spatial-temporal data, multimodal data), and learning types (e.g., federated learning, graph learning, self-supervised learning). The proposed framework will be evaluated on datasets and learning tasks from several domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, multimedia, and networking. The team will develop an open-source toolkit to make the techniques widely available to other researchers in academia, industry, and government.

The envisioned future engine has the potential to transform innovation deserts in the region into strong economic contributors and generators of high-quality employment opportunities.  The region of service includes 26 counties in North Texas and Southeastern Oklahoma.  Logistics represents the second largest business sector, with over 889 million tons valued at $1.1 trillion moving through the region and employing over 450,000 workers.  Like the national economy, the region is experiencing a significant shortfall in skilled labor.   In June 2022, over 500,000 logistics job openings existed nationally, with the driver shortfall alone at over 80,000.  These shortages are particularly pronounced in the region as the second-largest industrial and fourth-largest freight market. A collaboration of universities, companies, government agencies, and workforce development organizations will lead the activity, including the University of North Texas, Southern Methodist University, University of Texas-Arlington, Dallas College, Southeastern Oklahoma State University, Texas Research Alliance, Dallas Regional Chamber, the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, Hillwood Properties, City of Dallas, Workforce Solutions, and the Southern Dallas County Inland Port Transportation Management Association.<br/> <br/>The project will solicit use-inspired projects from the logistics community and address through research hubs located in disadvantaged areas to translate emerging technologies into innovative systems, practices, and workforce development programs. These hubs will conceptualize new products and services, incubate start-ups, and facilitate commercialization.  The envisioned future engine will incorporate three major technical thrusts:  autonomy, electrification, and cyber.  Autonomy integrates autonomous systems into logistics networks by generating innovations in surveillance/sending, computer vision, collision avoidance, object tracking, and smart city technologies. Cyber advances the technologies necessary for integrating logistics functions, data, and software across the supply chain, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, cybersecurity, optimization, and digital twins.  Electrification facilitates sustainable logistics by promoting innovations in renewable energy generation and microgrids, energy storage, battery technologies, hydrogen fuels, on-the-move EV wireless charging, energy harvesting, and grid resilience.  Workforce development overlays each thrust, and the project will closely collaborate with regional workforce development organizations to plan and develop new education vehicles and integrate these innovations and industry input into workforce training programs.  The Development Award will enable the creation of the Engine by promoting collaboration across universities, government and non-government entities, and logistics companies throughout the region and providing the support essential for creating the research hubs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the cloud service provider (CSP) operates the hardware and privileged software, a malicious CSP can readily access or alter a customer?s sensitive data, while a bug in the CSP?s software can allow an attacker to do the same. To improve cloud security, the major chip designers recently added support for confidential computing: running a workload in a secure hardware enclave where the workload?s memory is encrypted, thus shielding it from the CSP. This proposal advances the knowledge for extending confidential computing to distributed services, an increasingly common type of cloud computing.  The proposed research will develop innovative, open-source systems software for organizations to make use of essential cloud services without sacrificing their privacy or the privacy of their users. To prepare the next generation of cybersecurity practitioners, planned activities include the mentoring undergraduates and outreach programs for K-12 students.<br/><br/>The proposal?s central research questions are: (1) how must protocols handle authentication and authorization when some nodes in the system are enclaves, and (2) how can protocols safely encompass a mix of trusted and untrusted nodes, including nodes that an attacker compromised. The proposal investigates these questions for two important existing protocols: Transport Layer Security (TLS) and cloud object storage. Specifically, the proposal seeks to extend TLS to allow an enclave to authenticate itself using a set of identities (such as its launch measurement, runtime measurement, and domain name), and explores the use of joint signature schemes to make such authentication efficient and elegant. Having support for complex endpoint authentication, the proposal then develops extensions to TLS for authorizing how enclaves may share data, thus enforcing the flow of information through a distributed system of diverse parties. Finally, the proposal explores storage protocol extensions that mitigate the damage of key compromise in a shared, encrypted cloud object store by using efficient, enclave-assisted, key rotation and data re-encryption.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will do so by completing a research study that can reveal potential systemic limitations in access to computer science education by all students.  This research study will examine ten-years of undergraduate student application, admissions, and retention data from four institutions.  Analysis of these data will describe how students of varying demographics and pre-college preparation are present throughout the computer science talent pipeline. This study will fill an important research gap about factors that affect the flow of students into and through the computer science major. It is well documented that the demographic characteristics of computer science students are highly skewed toward males versus females and have skewed racial/ethnic distributions. What is not yet understood is at what point in the talent pipeline these imbalances are greatest and the degree to which they change as students progress through computer science undergraduate programs. In addition, the current educational disruption caused by COVID-19 provides the important and unique opportunity to determine what effect, if any, the resulting educational changes have had on participation of different groups of students in computer science. Students from underrepresented groups appear to have encountered greater difficulty accessing distance learning and being connected to the full range of educational opportunities presented by these unique circumstances, which are very strongly related to technological know-how. There is legitimate cause for concern that the pandemic will further divide the advantaged from the disadvantaged, further marginalizing the underrepresented groups that the project is studying from opportunities to advance into computer science majors and progress successfully through them. Computer science is an area of critical strategic importance for the nation, and a field in which cultivating domestic talent can have enormous impact.  Thus, examining pre- and post- pandemic patterns of participation in computer science have the potential to help the nation meet its growing needs for talent in computer science and related fields, such as cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. <br/><br/>This study will use a large, rich data set compiled from ten years of undergraduate application, admissions, and course-level data from four institutions:  Loyola Marymount University, Cal State University Long Beach, the University of California Riverside, and the University of California San Diego.  Analysis of these longitudinal data will improve understanding of who has access, who applies, who is admitted, and who succeeds in computer science. Using classical statistical approaches and modern machine learning based approaches to analysis of large data sets, the study seeks to understand how to improve the inclusion of all students in computer science. It will supplement this large-scale quantitative analysis with qualitative analysis of results from targeted focus-groups and interviews.  The qualitative analysis, coupled with the quantitative analysis of longitudinal data from four institutions with different student demographics and other characteristics, will provide a deeper analysis of access to and success in computer science than any previous study.  The resulting extension of knowledge has the potential to lay the foundation for achieving equitable access to computer science education for all students.

Complex systems are networks comprising many collaborating elements that continuously interact with each other in a nonlinear and counterintuitive manner; examples include cybersecurity, manufacturing processes, automated transportation infrastructure, medical devices, and many others relevant to our well-being. Faults in these systems are malfunctions, such as cyber-attack or sensor failure, that break security, degrade system functionality, and cause safety concerns and economic losses. Control of these systems is challenging because the dynamic behavior of the ensemble is intrinsically difficult to predict. This award supports fundamental research to build a ?fault-aware? control framework to study how interactions among individual elements produce the collective?s dynamics and how to alleviate the effect of faults on complex systems. To develop and test the control framework, a failing heart managed by a ventricular assist device will be used as the foundation to (i) detect device faults such as thrombosis and suction that jeopardize the survival of heart failure patients and (ii) automatically adjust the operation of the device under faults to improve the patient quality of life. The educational and outreach plan will focus on promoting active and life-long learning and engaging and training students at various levels, including veterans transitioning to civilian life, in emerging industries and transdisciplinary skills.<br/><br/>Using machine learning as the backbone, the objective of this research is to create a data-driven control strategy that regulates and maintains the system?s homeostasis following the onset of faults, while ensuring the system continues to operate in a seamless, continuous manner. This research will fill the knowledge gap for the supervision and control of complex systems when the governing phenomena are unknown and when first principle models are not readily attainable. The data-driven strategy will also overcome design limitations. Designing complex systems, such as ventricular assist devices, based on first principle models is costly, time consuming, and requires extensive expert knowledge to build application-specific models based on ubiquitous assumptions that are difficult to satisfy in practice. This research project will integrate data analytics, control theory, and machine learning into a unified framework with three innovative aspects: developing machine learning methods to discover symptomatic fingerprints of faults directly from data for real-time fault diagnosis; building an online adaptive modeling paradigm to predict performance-related variables that are not directly measurable due to economic considerations or technical constraints; designing a fault-tolerant controller to improve the system?s performance, while ensuring all operational constraints are met. In addition to its application to ventricular assist devices, this framework can be applied to protect computer systems from digital attacks, improve manufacturing efficiency, and address safety issues in automated transportation infrastructure and medical devices, leading to compelling societal and economic benefits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of these vulnerabilities arise from the widespread use of the C programming language, which provides little protection against the effects of common programmer mistakes. New hardware monitoring architectures can detect such errors and limit their security impact, but these protections only work when they are deployed correctly. This project aims to build a provably secure platform for executing C code on monitored hardware, using formal specification to define its desired behavior and formal verification to confirm that it is correctly implemented. Demonstrating the feasibility of this high-assurance platform will make it possible for engineers to adopt monitored hardware systems with confidence, with the ultimate goal of reducing cybersecurity threats to the systems that underpin our world.<br/><br/>The project will formally specify and verify C compiler infrastructure that targets emergent tag-based hardware architectures which support flexible and efficient security monitoring. Specific project contributions include (1) a novel specification language for describing C-level security properties in simple and flexible ways; (2) generic techniques for verified compilation of C programs and their associated security properties to tag-enhanced machine code; (3) a new C memory model which captures the minimum memory safety requirements needed to prove that the compiler preserves program behavior; (4) application of the compiler framework to implement formally specified and verified implementations of a broad spectrum of C memory safety policies; and (5) application of the framework to implement novel policies for compartmentalizing programs with controlled memory sharing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, scientific software security is concerningly overlooked: despite having many exploitable security vulnerabilities and growing calls for more stringent secure development practices, the scientific community currently lacks the suitable tools to thoroughly vet their software. As much of the software world has embraced the vulnerability-finding strategy known as ?fuzzing?, this project aims to transition recent advancements in cybersecurity, software engineering, and computer systems to enable thorough, systematic fuzzing of today?s complex scientific software. The outcomes of this proposal will enhance the overall security of scientific software?reducing the likelihood of future software-borne security breaches against the users, communities, and institutions that use it.<br/><br/>Existing fuzzing tools generally target small, single-language code with well-known input specifications, and thus fail to support the often multi-language, large, and esoteric nature of scientific software. Accordingly, this work aims to tackle these asymmetries by introducing (1) performant instrumentation with cross-language support; (2) fully-automated synthesis of thorough fuzzing harnesses; and (3) automated mining of formal input specifications. Beyond their release to the broader scientific software community, the tools and techniques resulting from this project are projected to be deployed on large-scale cyberinfrastructure through UVA?s ACCORD initiative as well as collaborating National Lab partners.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It monitors traffic reaching Internet address space that is not assigned to any hosts. This traffic is therefore unsolicited?a sort of pollution?and is constituted of an evolving mix of diverse traffic components originating from across the whole Internet. For more than two decades, network telescope instrumentation has enabled research breakthroughs by allowing global visibility into a wide range of Internet phenomena: from the automated spread of malicious software such as Internet viruses to Internet blackouts. Measurement and analysis of such macroscopic phenomena are of key relevance for the security and reliability of the Internet infrastructure but also provide data and inspire progress in interdisciplinary studies. However, due to the increasing scarcity of IPv4 address space, the size of telescopes has been progressively eroding over the years, to the point that some organizations stopped operating them or reduced their size, which lessens their research and educational utility. Another new issue with this research infrastructure is that malicious actors have been learning to ?blacklist? network telescopes and can avoid them when scanning the Internet. <br/><br/>A novel methodology, called dynamic network telescopes, overcomes these issues. A dynamic telescope is based on deploying programmable switches at the border of the organization?s network to continuously discover utilization of internal space and adaptively adjust the scope of traffic capture. This project deploys the very first implementation of such novel solution at the Merit network telescope, one of the largest network telescopes available to the research community. Merit is an independent nonprofit governed by Michigan?s public universities, which owns and operates America?s longest-running regional research and education network.

Scientific research relies heavily on cyber assets (networked components and services) that must operate securely to support fundamental scientific research and increase confidence in outcomes and conclusions. Developing robust security requires high-quality, trustworthy datasets to tune, test and validate security models and mechanisms. The research value of such datasets increases greatly if they are labeled, which is essential for developing new machine learning (ML) techniques, and establishing ground truth. However, due to their distributed nature, volume and privacy issues, labeled datasets have been extremely hard to produce and distribute to the security community while respecting user privacy.<br/><br/>LaSIC captures, labels and distributes real traffic from AmLight, a production international research and education network serving several scientific communities, to researchers working on securing scientific data and artifacts.

This makes dynamic networks vulnerable to the Sybil attack, where an adversary misrepresents itself as multiple participants in order to disrupt the network. Many Sybil defenses employ resource burning (RB), which is the verifiable expenditure of a network resource, such as computing power, computer memory, or bandwidth. Unfortunately, existing approaches require legitimate participants to constantly perform RB, regardless of whether an attack is occurring. The goal of this project is to design new Sybil defenses that are scalable; that is, the amount of RB is low in the absence of malicious behavior, and grows slowly as a function of the resources expended by the adversary to launch its attack. The outcomes of this research have the potential to secure a broad range of dynamic networks, such as content-sharing systems, e-commerce review platforms, and public-access server settings. This project will foster collaboration between cybersecurity practitioners and academia in the form of two research workshops.  The objectives of this project are also integrated with curriculum development, along with research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Three general application areas are addressed under this project: efficient group maintenance for secure peer-to-peer networks; defending against spam in e-commerce review systems; and cloud-based methods for mitigating denial-of-service attacks. In each area, defenses will be designed that protect critical security invariants at an RB cost to legitimate participants that is scalable: growing slowly with both the RB cost paid by an attacker and the rate at which legitimate participants join and depart the system. To achieve this, the project leverages a novel framework, whereby the amount of adversarial activity is estimated, and then participants are charged an RB cost based on this estimate. This framework can leverage existing machine learning (ML) results to estimate adversarial activity. Importantly, the guarantees provided by these defenses hold over persistent attacks, even with ML error. The theoretical components of this research effort will be complemented by empirical evaluations of the proposed defenses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project develops program-analysis-centric techniques that enable the investigation and remediation of ongoing infections as well as hardening against future CMS compromises, with the goals of 1) understanding the intent and strategy of a CMS infection and tracing their root-cause attack vector for reliable remediation, 2) revealing dynamic and sophisticated attack behaviors in malware samples in a CMS infection, 3) hardening of CMS deployments against future attacks. This project benefits national security and economic stability by creating cyber forensics and vulnerability detection techniques for CMS websites and the financial, government, and private sector operations they support. It provides server-side script code including malicious scripts and vulnerable code to help train next-generation cybersecurity experts. Students from underrepresented minority groups are involved in research activities.<br/><br/>This project develops Doctor WHO, a CMS analysis framework which combines rapid evidence collection and advanced program analysis techniques for the investigation and remediation of infections and hardening against future CMS compromises. Specifically, the data-driven prediction framework, called TARDIS, is developed to understand the temporal correlation of attack evidence across a corpus of real-world websites. TARDIS enables the automated discovery of the artifacts of a compromise, fingerprinting of the attack's propagation, and rapid investigation of cyberattacks against CMS deployments. The project also develops Torchwood, a cross-language and cross-environment program analysis framework to effectively analyze highly dynamic and sophisticated malware targeting CMSs. Torchwood can handle advanced obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques applied to malware and reveal hidden malicious behaviors and intentions of the malware effectively. Lastly, the project develops UNIT that enables the hardening and securing of CMS deployments against future attacks. UNIT accomplishes this by enabling automated dynamic testing of CMS-backed websites without requiring any runtime environment resources. UNIT eliminates false alerts and provide proof-of-concept exploits via a set of new methods to identify and model dependencies of runtime resources and reconstruct missing resources using instrumented script interpreter engines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over its six-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 38 unique full-time students who are pursuing bachelor?s degrees in Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Digital Forensics and Cybersecurity, Engineering, Geosciences, Mathematics, and Physics. First-year students will receive up to four years of scholarship support. The project will improve student persistence through a combination of academic, social, and professional supports including a first-year learning community, faculty mentoring, peer tutoring, early service-learning research opportunities, professional experience grants, major success maps, first-year seminars, and career counseling. The key impacts of this project are persistent improvements to STEM student recruitment and support systems at Commonwealth and a better understanding of the impact of targeted student success measures on scholar retention in STEM.  Because Commonwealth University serves a primarily rural and low-income region, this project has the potential to broaden participation in STEM disciplines and benefit economic development in north central Pennsylvania and the U.S. Science and Technology workforce.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. Towards this goal the project team will pursue three specific objectives. First, is to increase matriculation of low-income students in STEM disciplines by 10% compared to 2022-23. Second, is to retain 92% of project scholars from first- to second-year, and third, is to graduate 83% of project scholars in 4 years. This project will fill critical gaps in the understanding of the impacts of specific student success measures by first studying the effect of tools such as first year seminars, major success maps, professional experience grants, and service-learning on low income student success in STEM disciplines, as measured by metrics such 2-year retention rates, DFWI%, and 4- and 6-year graduation rates. Next, the project will explore how these tools improve student outcomes by investigating their effects on psycho-social constructs associated with increased retention and graduation such as self-efficacy, sense of belonging, and disciplinary identity. Third, and lastly, the project will develop understanding of activities that can be used to build cohort cohesion across multiple campuses. This project will be evaluated using a mixed-methods approach built on information from institutional research, interviews, surveys, and focus groups. Lessons learned and best practices will be shared with local, regional, and national audiences through presentations at STEM education and disciplinary conferences, publication in appropriate education and disciplinary journals, and a dedicated project webpage. This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Existing data for the treatment of alcohol and drug abuse are primarily collected through unreliable self-reports. Other methods are direct measurements on bodily fluids, breath, or sweat, which require penetration through the skin or physical maneuvering, and indirect estimates through interviews and observations. Non-invasive sensing and testing paired with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques offer the promise of vastly improved data collection methods and analysis that in turn can improve treatments. However, the world, and the United States in particular, faces a shortage of trained workforce and innovators in this field. This NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) award will address these needs by preparing master?s and doctoral students to make convergent research contributions in the interdisciplinary fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and secure networked sensing to tackle the growing alcohol and drug crisis, and other social pandemics. The project will provide a unique and comprehensive training opportunity for up to one hundred twenty graduate students, including twenty funded trainees, by combining the disciplines of AI, communication networks, cybersecurity, sensor technologies, interactions with healthcare and legal partners, and a culture of innovation and translational research that considers human factors, law, regulation, communication, and leadership.<br/><br/>This project examines the global and national alcohol/drug abuse crisis from a broad perspective, including technological, ethical, legal, and socioeconomic challenges and opportunities. It aims at making radical programmatic changes in the way traditional and non-traditional graduate students are trained. This crisis, which costs in work productivity, healthcare, and law enforcement expenses, requires interdisciplinary research to efficiently collect and assemble data, possibly from diverse sources, and analyze it to extract actionable information while being conscious of contextual factors, such as a consumer's health history, potential criminal record, personal background, and individual data security and privacy. The data aspects of this societal problem pose significant challenges on its collection, e.g., non-invasive sensing, and its secure and privacy-aware data analytics, which are the main research lines of this proposal. The project's students will get practical and multidisciplinary training to prepare them as future skilled professionals in the rapidly growing area of applications of AI and secure networked sensing technologies. The proposed model combines project-based learning techniques, multidisciplinary programs, ethics, civic engagement, leadership, and professional development and dissemination initiatives. The educational model structure will allow students from seven interdisciplinary doctoral and four master's programs to participate in the activities.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Particularly, AI-powered coding assistant tools (e.g., ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot) are believed to potentially revolutionize the software development landscape. The tools can enhance software developers' efficiency and productivity in software development by generating boilerplate code for developers. Unfortunately, the tools can generate (or suggest) insecure code for developers because (1) the models that the tools rely on can inadvertently learn from insecure code snippets of untrusted, unverified open-source projects, or (2) the models are also vulnerable to poisoning attacks. The project's novelties are to develop new curricular modules and hands-on exercises for computer science students and the software development workforce to enhance their secure coding practices when using the tools. The project's broader significance and importance are to equip students and the workforce with secure coding practices when using AI-powered coding assistant tools, thereby enabling them to develop secure programs in the future. Moreover, this project's activities will be used to attract undergraduate students from underrepresented groups to cybersecurity.<br/><br/><br/>The main objective of this education project is to help students and the workforce have secure coding practices. First, this project develops new hands-on exercises where the students and the workforce can learn how suggested insecure code can impact their software and how the software can be vulnerable and exploited by adversaries. This engages them in active security-oriented learning to cultivate their secure coding practices when using AI-powered coding assistant tools. The hands-on materials include a real-world programming environment where the learners are expected to have experience with poisoned models. Second, this project actively pursues the involvement of undergraduate/high school students in research, including underrepresented groups (specifically the Appalachia region).

Face-to-face human contacts, financial transactions, and computer communications can all be viewed as temporal networks where interactions are active only at certain points in time. Analyzing such networks is important for various applications such as maintaining cyber-secure environments in the context of national security. Another example, in the context of a client-server network of interactions, is determining whether there is a set of servers that interact with clients in an unusually coordinated way. In the context of money laundering, the lifeblood of criminal activities and a source of damages to economic competitiveness in the U.S., can we detect the accounts involved in coordinated cryptocurrency laundering while also performing licit transactions? This project devises a new paradigm for analyzing temporal networks effectively and efficiently and trains next-generation of computer scientists from diverse backgrounds by increasing public scientific engagement, performing outreach to marginalized communities, and course development. In particular, the investigator organizes workshops to reach high-school students from Hispanic, Burmese, and Somalis communities in the Buffalo area to inform and educate them about the basics of computer science and network science. Outputs, such as an open-source software framework for temporal network analysis and know-how on critical applications such as intrusion detection and anti-money laundering, are designed to advance and contribute to scientific understanding in various disciplines such as cybersecurity, economics, finance, and social network analysis.<br/><br/>This project designs and develops motif-based models and algorithms to analyze and process temporal networks. It will devise generic formalizations in a bottom-up approach by first building primitives in the microscale, then analyzing the subgraphs and periodicity in the mesoscale, and lastly extending the techniques for graphs encountered in real-world applications. This project broadens the knowledge with new models and algorithms that can work on temporal networks with fine resolution and a large timespan. To this end, there are two main research thrusts: (1) a framework for temporal motif analysis; and (2) mesoscale structures and graphs in the wild. The investigator performs theoretical and empirical evaluations for all the proposed models and algorithms. In particular, this project considers two real-world applications in collaboration with industry and government research labs; (1) intrusion detection in bipartite cyber logs; and (2) anti-money laundering in financial and cryptocurrency transactions.

However, the adoption of these technologies is stymied by their reliance on needing users to manage cryptographic keys (long strings of random characters). Prior research has shown users struggle to manage cryptographic keys, with existing key management systems often causing more problems than they solve. To improve the design of key management, this project investigates how key management is used in the real world. Data from these studies help identify which designs best promote utility, usability, and security, which designs fail to do so, and what new designs are needed. This project can improve our understanding of how to design key management systems that can be integrated with security-related technologies to increase their chance of being adopted. Results are being used to update and generate new curricula for university and K?12 students, helping educate and prepare the next generation of cybersecurity experts. The project will positively impact societal welfare and national defense.<br/><br/>This project includes collecting quantitative and qualitative data about the utility, usability, and security of existing systems that rely on key management. Data are gathered from users who have successfully adopted key management systems, such as developers using end-to-end email encryption and novice users adopting a key management system for the first time. The studies examine general usage, how usage changes over time, how users manage multiple cryptographic keys, how they synchronize keys between devices, and how they recover access to lost keys. Methods include interviews, surveys, observational studies, and usability studies.

The researchers assess the state of transport energy infrastructure and optimize it to accelerate the transition to zero-emission clean energy and connected vehicles (CECVs). The Center accomplishes this by developing converging scientific and technical partnerships among international governments, industries, and end users. It quantifies the anticipated impact of clean transportation on public health and the economy. It examines data and cybersecurity issues that affect CECVs. It unveils governance and policy change scenarios that enable clean transportation options accounting for technological innovations, economic prosperity, public health, and minimum carbon emissions. This NSF award also provides support and training for undergraduate and graduate students, and early-career scientists, at U.S. institutions, as well as educational outreach toward K-12 students, teachers, and the public.   <br/><br/>More specifically, the Global Center designs rigorous decision-support tools for communities and policymakers. CLEETS uses a systems approach to inform and guide the transition while maintaining prosperity and addressing climate impacts. The test beds for this multidisciplinary approach are three regions sharing common traits: the Great Lakes Megaregion in the U.S. and South Wales and the West Midlands in the UK. All three regions are manufacturing hubs with dense networks of roads and highways, national transport intersections vital for the economy yet threatening air quality. These regions' prosperity also depends on imported fuels and electricity. Yet, they also exhibit geographic and governmental/policy differences which can be tested. <br/><br/>This award is funded by the Global Centers program, an innovative partnership with funding agencies in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom, to jointly support use-inspired research addressing global challenges in climate change and clean energy. Partnerships with the Commonwealth Science and Innovation Research Organisation (CSIRO), Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC), and UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) leverage resources to tackle challenges at a larger scale than would be possible for one funding agency alone.

The overarching objective of this multicultural, interdisciplinary project is to provide the next generation of American engineers and scientists with a global perspective on collaboration, unique hands-on educational opportunities in the field of smart connected systems through international experiences thus enhancing future US global competitiveness, providing professional training and advancing and promoting science. To meet this objective, each year a six-student cohort will: 1) participate in a pre-travel training workshop with coordinated efforts from MC and CUNY/CSI; 2) spend 8 weeks in the summer working on the projects with professors from UZ; 3) engage in follow-up collaborative projects in areas of smart connected systems upon return to their home institutions. The core of the broader impacts is to increase the number of students who are under-represented in Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) and to participate in international research which is part of the evolving global economy. The effort will also leverage CSI?s Spanish-serving institution designation as well as CUNY?s unique status as the nation?s largest public university with a large under-represented minority student population to expose those students to the exciting undergraduate research opportunities that the involved institutions offer. <br/><br/>With the development of increasingly sophisticated intelligence technologies, we are entering an era of a smart connected world with Smart Connected Systems (SCS), which allows intelligent decision-making using data sources from both physical objects and virtual components to optimized efficiency, comfort, safety, and security. The unifying research theme of SCS includes sub-topics in sensors, optical networks, hybrid wired-wireless networks, machine learning, nature language processing, computer vision, image processing, and cybersecurity. Sample technical innovations that students will conduct in Spain include: 1) Analysis of Plastic Optical Fiber prospects as backbone for Smart Home Area Networks; 2) Development of smart home customized applications using natural language processing and speech recognition.

Thermal images capture the long-wave infrared signals to generate images and have broad applications in transportation, agriculture, and surveillance. This project develops 3D modeling and understanding methods based on thermal images. The developed 3D modeling technology can enable autonomous driving vehicles to detect the scene depth from thermal images to avoid traffic accidents.

The algorithms developed in this project will enable 3D reconstruction and understanding tasks for invisible scenes. The output from this project will allow related services provided for visible objects and during the daytime to be also available for invisible objects and during nighttime, such as hidden object inspection and navigation in the nighttime.

With the emergence of human-in-the-loop systems at the network edge, such as virtual reality, autonomous vehicles, mobile health, and smart financial systems, the integrity of timing primitives is more important than ever for user security and safety. Although there have been advances in isolated domains such as trusted clock sources in shielded hardware systems, secure time synchronization protocols, and resilient high-resolution timers, realizing secure time architectures for widespread adoption in zero-trust edge environments is hindered by two key challenges. First, trusted processors do not provide secure and precise access to their timekeeping source. Second, there is no universal time transfer technique that is resilient to delay attacks in the network, and hence, existing approaches are not suitable for adoption over heterogeneous and large-scale edge deployments. The proposed work is the first effort to provide an end-to-end, secure time architecture for edge systems with diverse clocks, for timestamping and time transfer. This project is also the first to study active and passive sensing mechanisms for secure time coordination. The proposed work also investigates challenges to secure time-sensitive networking in 5G networks, distinguished by support for emerging time-critical applications at large scales. This project will advance the state-of-the-art in secure timing with new clock sources, time transfer channels, and network protocols.<br/><br/>The proposed cross-stack approach reimagines core concepts in timing -a fundamental primitive used by all networked systems- and will create a foundation for designing safe, secure, and efficient systems. The diverse and secure clock sources will enable researchers and industry partners to support emerging applications with strict timing requirements over real-world edge deployments. The project also creates opportunities for education and outreach: The project will incorporate research on time security into new and existing graduate and advanced undergraduate classes at the PIs' home institution as part of the Cybersecurity Institute.

A possible solution to such a risk is to implement privacy-preserving protocols between users and third parties that prevent any private information disclosure in the first place. For instance, a user could prove to a third party that she holds a valid password without revealing the password. While solutions for such privacy-preserving problems exist, such solutions are poorly adapted to the open-access, noisy, bandwidth-limited, and distributed nature of wireless networks. Resorting to privacy-preserving protocols unadapted to wireless communication networks may result in suboptimal/inefficient solutions or, even worse, compromise privacy. This project addresses this challenge with a novel framework for privacy-preserving communication specifically adapted to wireless networks. The anticipated benefits are stronger privacy guarantees, improved data rates, and improved scalability, compared to traditional approaches. The project integrates an educational component in the broad field of cybersecurity under the form of i) graduate student training, ii) project- and research-oriented undergraduate student education, and iii) outreach to K-12 students.<br/><br/>This project aims to build a comprehensive framework that will enable the fundamental understanding and design of privacy-preserving wireless communication protocols. The construction of this framework is organized around three thrusts. In the first thrust, to improve data rates and scalability, the project investigates novel building blocks for privacy-preserving protocols that incorporate wireless communication constraints and enable multiuser communication protocols. In the second thrust, the project investigates solutions to make privacy-preserving protocols robust to adversarial behaviors. For instance, legitimate protocol users could exhibit malicious behaviors, or unauthorized network users could launch wireless-specific attacks, such as eavesdropping, jamming, or man-in-the-middle attacks.

An adversary can exploit the connections between the layers and launch an advanced persistent threat (APT) attack that is accomplished through a set of multi-stage stealthy and continuous hacking processes.  Lessons learned from APT attacks have highlighted the fact that the design for perfect security is not always possible or prohibitively expensive, and hence resilience is an equally important mechanism that can complement the imperfect security. The standard analysis tools are insufficient to cope with the complexity of CPS and address the design of security and resilience mechanisms.  To this end, the project aims to establish an integrated game-theoretic framework that adopts both reductionist and integrative approaches to engineer high-confidence CPS. The proposed research uses electric power systems and the cloud-enabled autonomous systems as two case studies to illustrate the designs of cyber defense strategies, resilience control mechanisms, and CPS security-aware contracts as the holistic cyber, physical, and human solution to for next-generation high-confidence infrastructure systems. <br/><br/>The methodologies developed in the project establish an inter-disciplinary system science to conceptualize and design high-confidence CPS, and expedite the realization of CPS in a wide range of applications including transportation, industrial automation, and the power grid. The project first leverages system engineering principles to create game motifs or gamelets as building blocks and use them to compose a game of games or meta-game to model heterogeneous interactions of system components within the layers, across the layers, and with an adversary. As the perfect security at the cyberspace is not always possible, the project develops a resilient control mechanism to provide an alternative paradigm of protection by maintaining critical functions of the CPS and mitigating the impact of cyber insecurity on the physical layer. At the socio-economic level, the proposed CPS contracts aim to create an incentive-compatible secure provision of CPS services and mitigate security risks by incentivizing proper security management of the service providers and reducing the risks of the users. The research is fully integrated into the educational plan via the incorporation of new courses as well as the training of undergraduate and graduate students via mentoring, participation in test-bed development, special projects, and internships at research labs.

Recently, AI has been emerging as a prominent tool for biological data analyses including assisting with medical diagnostics as well as the detection of disease-related mutations in genetics and genomics. We aim to employ AI to improve and refine gene functional annotations as well as predict functions for previously unclassified genes in Arabidopsis, a model plant system. Given that biological systems including plant-pathogen interactions are exceedingly complex and genes to phenotype relationships require an understanding of diverse layers of biological information, we will utilize a deep learning- and network-based framework that can integrate multiple heterogeneous datasets to obtain more accurate inferences of gene functions. We will validate our computational findings using experimental approaches. Specifically, we will focus on a set of genes that are related to ?Sulfur?, which is considered ?the 4th major phytonutrient? using genetics and plant pathology approaches. We expect a variety of deliverables to a wide range of users including researchers both nationally and internationally, educators in high schools, systems biology and bioinformatics specialists, and the plant research community in general. This will provide biological insights, gene prioritization, and testable hypotheses to plant researchers. Moreover, we will discern the molecular mechanisms of newly identified genes in plant defense. This project will also significantly contribute towards local education and outreach priorities through a minority-oriented program, PlantGIFT (Plant Genomics Internship For Teachers. <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Network science and deep learning, a subtype of machine learning enable predictive modeling from large and multi-dimensional datasets and elucidate the complex relationships among various layers of ?omics to predict the function(s) of the proteins. We aim to apply a hybrid method encompassing network biology and deep learning computational approach to predict gene functions for the unclassified genes as well as refine the Gene Ontology for the inadequately annotated genes. Specifically, we will generate a suite of diverse co-expression networks using transcriptome studies derived from a wide spectrum of biotic and abiotic stress treatments including plant-pathogen interactions. These co-expression networks will be integrated to transcription factor-targets and protein-protein interaction networks. Network topological features will be extracted from the above-described diverse ?omics networks and integrated into the predicted function(s) for each node. Moreover, we will predict Arabidopsis genome-wide gene functions using a deep neural networks-based integrative framework that can efficiently perform network embedding on heterogeneous networks. The precision of these computationally derived gene function predictions will be independently validated through genetics- and pathology-based experimental assays. In particular, we will focus on a GO term ?sulfur? and investigate the biological functions of 60 genes and a pair of regulatory transcription factors in biotic and abiotic stresses including plant defense. We will also establish PlantGIFT (Plant Genomics Internship For Teachers) to integrate research, education, and outreach for minority participation in genomics and plant sciences.

Adversarial training is currently the most widely used method to improve the robustness of neural networks against adversarial perturbations, but this approach has been found to have limitations, such as overfitting. In addition, the understanding of both attacks and adversarial training is still limited. In light of these challenges, this research aims to develop a theoretical analysis that sheds light on the robustness of neural network-based methods and the properties of adversarial training. This understanding is essential to the design of effective attack strategies and defense mechanisms for various machine learning models.

Another class is where the rules are not provided, and the solver only has access to a simulator in which to practice. This setup occurs in defense applications, real-time strategy settings, trading simulations, etc. This research will significantly increase the scalability of solving algorithms for both classes in the most realistic setting: multi-step imperfect-information strategic interactions.

However, the current distributed learning systems over IoT face inevitable challenges, mainly categorized into security, privacy, compatibility, and efficiency. For instance, first, the success of most existing learning systems relies heavily on a central server to coordinate the learning process. Second, traditional distributed learning requires the data on different devices to be in the same type/dimension. Third, the learning efficiency of the existing frameworks is another major concern. This work aims to systematically design a secure and fully decentralized learning method over IoT devices that enables the system to learn patterns from heterogenous data, i.e., data in different types/dimensions. This work will also deploy the developed method on a decentralized platform, i.e., blockchain, and design corresponding system protocols to eliminate the need to use a central server as in traditional distributed learning. On the other hand, the proposed system aims to exploit potential system vulnerabilities, develop attack and defense mechanisms, and theoretically analyze the system's reliability. Moreover, this work lays the groundwork for system research in dense IoT applications supported by decentralized learning. It generates preliminary experimental data necessary to develop an independent and competitive research agenda.<br/> <br/>This work will extend the traditional distributed/federated learning into a more general and practical scenario under IoT, where various types of data and IoT devices exist in the system.

There are three key challenges that hinder the efficiency of foraging robot swarms in practice. Firstly, while homogeneous ground robot swarms are efficient, they face limitations in Tsearching for multiple targets or resources in a large area due to limited sensing and mobility capabilities. Secondly, machine learning models that determine robot behavior are traditionally trained on a central server, which is not scalable when dealing with heterogeneous robots with varying configurations. Finally, sensor malfunctions and adversarial attacks are likely to occur in robot swarms and can lead to cascading effects that reduce the robustness and resilience of the swarm. This project leverages a promising interdisciplinary approach across robotics, machine learning, and cybersecurity to achieve a scalable, robust, and resilient foraging robot swarm with heterogeneous robots.

Rapid growth in human population and its ability to adapt to a variety of environmental conditions has resulted in unprecedented levels of interaction between humans and other species. This rise in interaction combined with emerging trends in globalization, anti-microbial resistance, urbanization, climate change, and ecological pressures has increased the risk of a global pandemic. Computation and data sciences can capture the complexities underlying these disease determinants and revolutionize real-time epidemiology --- leading to fundamentally new ways to reduce the global burden of infectious diseases that has plagued humanity for thousands of years. This Expeditions project will enable novel implementations of global infectious disease computational epidemiology by advancing computational foundations, engineering principles, theoretical understanding, and novel technologies. The innovative tools developed will provide new analytical capabilities to decision makers and result in improved science-based decision making for epidemic planning and response. They will facilitate enhanced inter-agency and inter-government coordination and outbreak response. The team will work closely with many local, regional, national, and international public health agencies and universities to apply and deploy powerful technologies during epidemic outbreaks that can be expected to occur during the course of the project. International scientific networks linked to a comprehensive postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate student training program will be established. Educational programs to foster interest in and increase understanding of computational science in addressing the complex societal challenges due to pandemics will also be developed. The team, with partners in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America, will produce multidisciplinary scientists with diverse skills related to public health.  <br/><br/>The novel implementations of this project will be enabled by the development of a rigorous computational theory of spreading and control processes on dynamic multi-scale, multi-layer (MSML) networks, along with tools from AI, machine learning, and social sciences. New techniques resulting from this research will make it possible to develop and apply large-scale simulations of epidemics and social interactions over MSML networks. These simulations, in turn, will provide fundamentally new insights into how to control epidemics. Pervasive computing technologies will be developed to support disease surveillance and real-time response.  The computational advances will also be generalizable; that is, they will be applicable to other areas such as cybersecurity, ecology, economics and social sciences. The project will take into account emerging concerns and constraints that include: preserving privacy of individuals and vulnerable groups, enabling model predictions to be interpreted and explained, developing effective interventions under uncertain and unknown network data, understanding strategic and adversarial behaviors of individual agents, and ensuring fairness of the process across the entire population. The research team includes experts from multiple disciplines and will address these societal  concerns and constraints in practical, impactful, and novel ways, including the development of computational tools and techniques to support sound, ethical science-based policy  pertaining to public health infectious disease epidemiology. Center for Computational Research in Epidemiology (CoRE) at the University of Virginia will be established as a part of the project.

Nowadays, desktops or laptops are gradually replaced by mobile and embedded devices. Behind these portable, low cost, low latency devices, are the Internet and Cloud Computing infrastructure, which shift computationally intensive tasks to remote data centers. This model will be more energy efficient in a long run. Recently, serverless computing has emerged in the market and evolved into an alternative to the traditional server-based computing because the users will be only billed the time their functions run on the cloud. Accompanying the energy gain and new billing flexibility, are security concerns throughout all layers of this architecture. Specifically, the co-residency of tenants? workloads scheduled in serverless platforms creates opportunities for attackers to invade other workloads or steal sensitive information. However, existing resource management algorithms fail to take security into consideration since most scheduler designs focus on performance and quality of service. To address these issues, Prairie View A&M University collaborates with Texas A&M University to develop a security-centric, attack-facing, intelligent, human-centered approach to resource management for serverless platforms under internet and cloud-based threats. This project aims at enhancing cybersecurity research and education, contributing research results, datasets, and educational material through publication and open sourcing. <br/><br/>The research activities are structured into three thrusts. The first thrust presents a novel reinforcement-based formulation for a multi-platform dynamic optimization scheme to balance performance and security. The second thrust envisions a data-driven solution to address critical attack factors in serverless computing. Finally, the third thrust lays out approaches to incorporate the research activities into educational and training environments. The overarching goal of this project is to establish a successful research infrastructure for explorations of how security-centric resource management can improve the security of serverless computing. Furthermore, this project investigates the best practices and pathways for research collaboration between a minority-serving institution and a first-tier research institution and encourages awareness and interest in security among students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Various active IP protection techniques have been investigated to secure hardware IPs against these threats. With the emergence of a broad range of attacks on these techniques, there is a need for a principled approach to enable robust protection against possible attacks, while achieving low hardware overhead and scalability to large designs. The key novelty of this project is the use of diverse Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, such as reinforcement learning and explainable algorithms for automated discovery of new hardware security attacks and deriving commensurate design transformations to effectively protect against these attacks. The research outcomes from this project are used to develop new cybersecurity courses, increase the participation of undergraduate/high-school students in research, and release of open-source tools/datasets for the broader research community. This project also contributes to enhancing the security and trustworthiness of electronic hardware and greatly benefits the semiconductor industry, as well as making a positive impact on national security.<br/> <br/>This project is developing a new framework for microelectronic security and trust. The approach utilizes a fundamentally different, knowledge-guided systematic design transformation approach for securing IP against RE attacks. This framework mimics the way security researchers and engineers gather knowledge from existing attacks to discover novel attack vectors and their root causes. Furthermore, the method can devise strong defense strategies to mitigate the newly discovered attacks and apply these defense strategies in a scalable manner to create a protected design with minimal design overhead. This project comprises of three parts: (1) the reinforcement learning techniques discover novel attack vectors against logic locking and identify root causes behind the success of these attacks, (2) explainable diverse Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used to extract design transformation rules that can defend against diverse attack vectors, (3) the discovered design rules are applied to successfully meet design and security requirements while also ensuring correctness. The research team is also developing novel security metrics and integrating all the components into a comprehensive IP protection platform for rapid evaluations. Moreover, the research team also extends the framework to other Design-for-Security  techniques, such as fault, side-channel, and Trojan attack countermeasures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Large-scale data collection has significant privacy concerns due to the growing data breaches. Different kinds of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) exist. Still, they all have various limitations in efficiency and scalability due to the scale and complexity of real-world applications, requiring large-scale and complex data processing. This project aims to develop methodologies and a theoretical foundation for heterogeneous secure computation for large-scale data processing, where different kinds of secure computation technologies are integrated into a seamless pipeline such that one can achieve the efficiency and scalability that cannot be attained by any existing secure computation paradigm alone. The heterogeneous secure computation framework resulting from this project will enhance cybersecurity, individual privacy, and national security by significantly improving the efficiency and scalability of secure computations performed on encrypted data. Moreover, this research will support the development of a diverse cohort of Ph.D., undergraduate, and high school students via the novel Research Experience for High Schoolers (REHS) program to be developed from the project and other education and outreach activities.<br/><br/>Underlying the proposed work is a novel idea of integrating the two seemingly disjoint secure computation paradigms: homomorphic computations and confidential computing. The project goal is to, by combining different secure computation primitives into a pipeline of heterogeneous secure computation, achieve the efficiency, scalability, and generalizability that cannot be attained by any individual secure computation primitive. Three interconnected research thrusts will be investigated for this goal. Firstly, confidential computing and homomorphic computations will be integrated into a pipeline such that one large-scale data processing workflow can be decomposed into several sub-computations that are handled by either confidential or homomorphic computations. Secondly, a heterogeneous trusted execution environment (TEE) will be researched to overcome the security and scalability limitations of existing TEEs, with novel zero-knowledge enclave verification and end-to-end attestation across different TEEs. Finally, parallel and distributed computing will be studied in the context of the new heterogeneous secure computation such that the unique challenges of applying parallel and distributed computing in this new heterogeneous framework are addressed. The research outcomes will be an end-to-end heterogeneous secure computation framework with high efficiency and scalability that are comparable to the plain computations without any security or privacy guarantees. The project outcomes will include (1) open-source projects implementing the framework, (2) scientific articles presented/published at conferences and journals, and (3) novel education materials for REHS and a new graduate-level course in homomorphic and confidential computing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The intellectual merits of the project include developing novel optimization, graph theory, low-rank matrix theory, and machine learning-based methods for optimal planning and operation of moving target defense devices, rapid detection, accurate identification, and robust mitigation of cyber data integrity attacks. The broader impacts of the project include promoting public awareness and understanding of smart grid cybersecurity, contributing to power engineering education, and preparing a diverse learning community, including middle and high school students, with requisite knowledge and skillsets to tackle future power grid security challenges. The successful completion of this project will provide power system operators with new tools to enhance situational awareness and better defend the power grid against cyber data attacks.<br/><br/>MTD is an emerging concept originally introduced for computer and communication networks. Existing MTD approaches are limited to the cyber layer of a cyber-physical system. However, if field devices or internal communication networks are physically compromised, adverse consequences are trigged within the physical layer. Therefore, the cyber-layer MTD alone is inadequate for securing real-world power grids with significant attack surfaces. The goal of this CAREER project is to develop and validate physical-layer MTD approaches to detect, identify, and mitigate data integrity attacks by strong adversaries with state-of-the-art machine learning capabilities. The proposed MTD approaches feature three major technical innovations: 1) A minimum spanning tree-enabled planning scheme that maximizes MTD detection effectiveness while considering system economic and reliability metrics; 2) A novel alternating current optimal power flow operational framework, constrained by scalable voltage stability approaches, to ensure the MTD hiddenness and detection performance; and 3) A low-rank matrix decomposition method assisted by MTD approaches that radically improves the attack identification speed and measurement recovery accuracy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are three key challenges that hinder the efficiency of foraging robot swarms in practice. Firstly, while homogeneous ground robot swarms are efficient, they face limitations in Tsearching for multiple targets or resources in a large area due to limited sensing and mobility capabilities. Secondly, machine learning models that determine robot behavior are traditionally trained on a central server, which is not scalable when dealing with heterogeneous robots with varying configurations. Finally, sensor malfunctions and adversarial attacks are likely to occur in robot swarms and can lead to cascading effects that reduce the robustness and resilience of the swarm. This project leverages a promising interdisciplinary approach across robotics, machine learning, and cybersecurity to achieve a scalable, robust, and resilient foraging robot swarm with heterogeneous robots.

The IoT is a rapidly improving, transformative field that is bound to positively impact global job markets and industries. With continued advancement in science and technology comes the need to educate K-12 students in emerging technologies to better prepare them for future academic and professional pursuits. This project aims to develop, implement, and evaluate an Internet of Things (IoT) based educational curriculum and technology that provides grades 9-12 students with Computer Science (CS) and Software Engineering (SE) education. At its core, the IoT technology uses inexpensive microcomputers that run code to collect, analyze, and share data with other devices or users.  Due to this inherent integration between hardware and software, IoT has the potential to serve as an excellent platform for teaching CS and SE to high school students. Grades 9-12 teachers and students from diverse and varied socioeconomic backgrounds will participate in this curricular experience through their STEM/CS/Engineering classes. Broad dissemination through online platforms, summer camps, and museums will be used to share content, testimonials, teaching strategies, and best practices to a wide audience in the K-12 education community. Over three hundred high school students and 27 teachers will be engaged directly in-class or via outreach activities. The skills and knowledge gained as part of this curricular experience will provide strong college and career readiness to high school students.  <br/><br/>The proposed IoT pedagogical ecosystem features an innovative approach to bringing CS and SE education to grades 9-12 by immersing students in the technical challenges of building web-connected physical computing systems. This project will focus on identifying critical elements for effective instructional design for CS and SE education by understanding student and teacher motivation. A key innovation of this effort will be the low-cost, IoT-hardware kits for project-based learning to create a hands-on experience in the classroom. The curriculum will involve real-world projects inspired by the National Academy of Engineering grand challenges that have direct applications in the industry (e.g., urban infrastructure, wearable technology, connected vehicles, connected health, and cybersecurity). Continuous and methodical assessment via rubrics and focus groups will enable data collection on students? CS/SE/IoT knowledge and skills, teamwork skills, and overall engagement. Rigorous quantitative statistical analysis (parametric and non-parametric) and qualitative methods (first cycle and second cycle coding) will be used to answer three research questions: 1) What is the impact of IoT-based projects on students? CS, SE, and hardware skills and knowledge? 2)What is the effect of IoT-based projects on students? engagement and teamwork skills? 3) What factors of instructional design promote/hinder engagement?

The trucking sector has been heavily investing in platooning technologies in recent years, driven primarily by the significant benefits of truck energy use reduction. This project will investigate the fundamental issue of promoting widespread truck platooning while accounting for 1) individual truck preferences, given the high fragmentation of the US trucking sector; 2) inclusion of trucks of different origins, destinations, and planned departure time in forming platoons; and 3) preservation of truck information privacy. Results from the research, which will be produced in collaboration with the industry, will help inform truck platooning implementation in the US toward reaping the maximum benefits. The research also aligns with the growing societal emphasis on individual member well-being, inclusiveness, privacy, and cybersecurity. Diverse student groups will be exposed to the subject of truck platooning and technology-empowered smart mobility in general through systematic education and outreach efforts. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to establish a theoretical foundation for maximizing truck platooning participation taking into consideration truck preferences, inclusion, and privacy preservation. An interactive process between trucks and a platooning platform is first devised to facilitate construction of the preference list of platooning partners for each truck. The research then investigates two approaches for platooning participation maximization: one centers on stably partitioning trucks into parties of cycled preferences; the other resorts to integer programming with exploration of half-integrality of the extreme points for efficient solution methods. Multiple inclusion measures are further developed and integrated into the platooning participation maximization. To preserve privacy while seeking platooning opportunities, an encrypted computing design is conceived and examined for constructing truck preference lists. The core of the design is a two-cloud architecture with secret key splitting, ciphertext re-encryption, and obfuscation which leverages the additive homomorphic property of the chosen cryptosystem. Disaggregate truck flows based on real-world freight data will be constructed and used to test and evaluate the different research components at varying geographical scales. The results from this project will not only contribute to enriching the truck platooning literature but lend insights to several other emerging mobility systems that bear operational similarities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In an era where digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies, have attained over a trillion dollars in market value, the need for public and private collaboration is not just important, but essential. Recognizing the dynamic nature of the digital asset market, the DACH project aims to create a robust framework that can adapt to market fluctuations and maintain relevance. The DACH project's impact extends beyond the financial and cryptocurrency sectors, reaching into vital areas like healthcare, advanced manufacturing, supply chain management, energy, transportation, dynamic contracting/autonomy and Web3.0 related products and services. Additionally, DACH presents an opportunity for public and private sector innovators to work together to mitigate and deal with a range of risks, frauds, and scams in this space. By fostering a public/private partnership with extensive participation, the DACH project aims to create an inclusive environment that caters to the diverse needs and interests of society, thereby democratizing financial systems and reducing inequalities.<br/><br/>Technical challenges DACH will tackle include decentralized notification attacks, multi-call transaction audits, malevolent submission of multiple invalid proposals, and the risk associated with on-chain transaction verifications using multi-sig wallets. The operational value of addressing these technical risks through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) includes elimination of information silos through a decentralized communications model, improved access, availability of ethical hacker cybersecurity experts during the four stages of innovation, frictionless access to prospective customer comments as an iterative use case feedback mechanism, and reduced participant apathy through game theory. Managed by US subject matter experts, this ?innovation sandbox? will offer a controlled environment where innovators can collaborate, build value, and mitigate risk by normalizing broadly diverse inputs. For example, a Dust Network DAO could encourage adopting sustainable and responsible space exploration (i.e., creating a standardized debris removal process). The DAO might include a Space Treaty expert, thereby avoiding unanticipated adverse effects of governmental actions. A start-up is establishing a DAO to bring transparency to class action lawsuits. The first use case is related to Camp Lejeune military veterans suffering from the health effects of contaminated water. Camp Lejeune victims have fallen prey to predatory lawyers seeking access to over $6B in funds set aside by Congress. The DAO will enable collaboration across a wide range of stakeholders including doctors, pathologist, lawyers, and military services to ensure transparency and accountability of funds intended for veterans. Another use case is the Battery DAO which links the sale of sustainable energy generation (i.e., rooftop solar panels) from local neighborhoods and fairly shares financial gains using DAO-based governance.  The above are just early examples, as the DAO will enable support for a wide range of innovations and collaborations.  Like cloud computing, which now represents the epitome of IT infrastructure provisioning for any industry, the DACH will establish a model for innovation within the digital asset ecosystem. Though considered a high-risk high-reward project, the benefits far outweigh the short-term risks. As a result, this project has garnered widespread interest from diverse potential stakeholders, including five (5) federal agencies (two cabinet level), healthcare providers, Web 3.0 companies, public transportation operators, investors, and a disparate group of entrepreneurial startups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because food is so fundamental, automating kitchens can have far-reaching impacts beyond the usual kinds in technology ethics. Kitchens are often the heart of our homes, where traditions and science education are passed along to children. Restaurants and their kitchens are also the heart of our communities and culture. Automating that creative labor may impact values that society cares about, such as: child development, family and communal relationships, gender roles, cultural and religious traditions, authenticity, nutrition and wellbeing, food safety and waste, kitchen hygiene, economic vitality, agriculture, and more. Given this interdisciplinary complexity and potential for widespread disruption, responsible innovation here requires anticipating and addressing possible harms, while maximizing the benefits. The current project develops a framework and analysis of these ethical and societal factors to understand the risks associated with robotic kitchens.<br/><br/><br/>As the first extensive conversation on the subject, the project will map out and develop a full range of issues in this emerging space, looking at both benefits and risks. It also builds upon and advances more familiar issues in technology ethics, such as economic displacement, social isolation, pursuit of efficiency and convenience, artificial intelligence bias and errors, cybersecurity, and so on. To ensure that the work is inclusive, three workshops will be held in different global geographies to help account for cultural or regional differences in attitudes and impacts. The goal is to deliver a public ?ethics impact report? on the subject, along with other scholarly products and public outreach. Automation always comes with trade-offs, and it is even more essential to apply foresight to automation in domains like this, which are so entangled with relationships, cultures, and societies. In addition to these broader impacts, curriculum development, outreach and educational activities are planned as part of this research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, data-driven techniques can enable better quality of experience for content distribution over the Internet, better wireless communication techniques, and better attack detection techniques for emerging cybersecurity threats. Unfortunately, a pervasive lack of data limits the potential of data-driven research and development. Data holders are often reluctant to share datasets for fear of revealing business secrets or running afoul of regulations. These data access challenges will become (and already are) a fundamental stumbling block for innovation in next-generation networks.<br/><br/>This project aims to tackle this impasse with synthetic data ?-- data that exhibits the same statistical patterns as real data, without the need to explicitly share the original source data. Synthetic datasets can be safely released to enable cross-stakeholder collaboration. Synthetic data generation techniques, however, have classically suffered from poor data quality. This proposal explores how to leverage and extend recent advances in machine learning to use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic models of networking datasets. Realizing the potential benefits of GAN-generated synthetic data for networking systems, however, is challenging on multiple fronts. First, network traffic datasets (e.g., packet captures) entail complex relationships that raise new fidelity and scalability implications for prior GAN models. Second, networking use cases pose new (and traditional) privacy requirements, and the resulting privacy-fidelity tradeoffs remain poorly understood. Finally, several networking use cases entail studying rare or extreme events (e.g., outages, flash crowds, attacks). Data for such extreme events by definition is rare and challenging for GANs (or any synthetic data model) to learn. This project will tackle interdisciplinary challenges spanning networking, machine learning, and privacy to develop novel foundations for GAN-enabled workflows for supporting data-driven operations in next-generation network systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of populations underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM.<br/><br/>For the United States (U.S.) to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy. The Iowa-Illinois-Nebraska STEM Partnership for Innovation in Research and Education LSAMP (IINSPIRE) program was established in 2011 in response to the need for a more diverse and skilled technical workforce. The 16 two-year and four-year colleges and universities that make up the Alliance are diverse and include 10 four-year institutions, five community colleges, and one tribal college. The institutions are Augustana College, Des Moines Area Community College, Doane University, Eastern Iowa Community College District, Grinnell College, Hawkeye Community College, Iowa State University, Iowa Valley Community College District, Kirkwood Community College, Little Priest Tribal College, Luther College, Nebraska Wesleyan University, University of Iowa, University of Northern Iowa, Upper Iowa University, and Wartburg College. The goal of the Alliance is to increase the number of STEM baccalaureate degrees awarded annually, and increase the community college transfer enrollment, and to enroll a cohort of Alliance students in STEM graduate programs. These goals will be accomplished by continuing successful programming from previous years and by expanding the campus-specific student experience model, in which each campus customizes a general model based on their own needs and contexts. The models include various high-impact practices, including undergraduate research experiences. This approach enables campus leaders to share effective practices and learn from one another. It is central to supporting institutionalization and sustainability in different academic environments. These goals support the National Science Foundation's strategic goal to ""cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens.""<br/><br/>The Alliance's broadening participation research is guided by two questions: (1) How does participation in IINSPIRE LSAMP mediate students? goals over time? (2) How does the IINSPIRE LSAMP alliance create an intentional network to broaden the participation of racially and ethnically minoritized students across STEM fields? A blended theoretical framework drawing on community cultural wealth, intersectionality, and social cognitive career theory facilitates studying both individual student experiences and contextual factors. This research is also investigating how alliance institutions engage students in STEM fields, including newer, emergent fields, such as artificial intelligence, data science, cybersecurity, and quantum science and technology. Preparation and partnerships in these fields is a broader impact of the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A proof-of-concept attack hit the Ukraine in 2015, and cut off the power supply to hundreds of thousands of people for several hours. In many successful cyber attacks so far, security vulnerabilities in software have played an important role, exposing systems to attackers who aim to compromise and hence control the system. Vulnerabilities may exist in controllers, meters, circuit breakers, and control computers, and as such, electric utilities usually use vulnerability and patch management to monitor the security vulnerabilities of assets, analyze the remediation and mitigation action for each vulnerability (e.g., applying a patch), and deploy the action to secure the vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them. This remains a heavily manual process in the energy sector, where electric utilities spend a tremendous amount of time on such analyses over a large number of vulnerabilities, and increases the time window in which vulnerabilities are known but not mitigated, putting the system into a high risk of being attacked. This problem has received insufficient attention and has defied commercial solutions. This project will address this problem through automating this analysis process. If successful, it will drastically reduce the human resources and time spent by electric utilities on vulnerability and patch management, and increase the security of the nation's energy infrastructure through mitigating vulnerabilities much more quickly. This project will also develop a training course for security operators in electric utilities and a graduate-level course on vulnerability and patch management. Industry workshops and tutorials on security conferences will be developed to disseminate research discoveries. Undergraduate students and underrepresented students will be involved in the research.<br/> <br/>This project aims to develop methodologies for automated vulnerability and patch management in electric utilities that can expedite decision making of how to remedy and mitigate security vulnerabilities. It has several research tasks. (i) Develop an automated solution that can predict whether a vulnerability should be patched immediately or mitigated in other ways. A prediction model will be built using machine learning methods to predict human operators' remediation actions for vulnerabilities, and easy-to-verify rationale will be provided so that security operators can validate the predictions if needed. (ii) Design a quantitative approach for automating mitigation action analysis. This task will devise a data flow model to capture the interactions between mitigation actions and system components and the interactions among system components, and formulate mitigation action selection as an optimization problem, where the goal is to minimize the negative impact of the selected mitigation actions for a given set of vulnerabilities to the power grid.

This makes dynamic networks vulnerable to the Sybil attack, where an adversary misrepresents itself as multiple participants in order to disrupt the network. Many Sybil defenses employ resource burning (RB), which is the verifiable expenditure of a network resource, such as computing power, computer memory, or bandwidth. Unfortunately, existing approaches require legitimate participants to constantly perform RB, regardless of whether an attack is occurring. The goal of this project is to design new Sybil defenses that are scalable; that is, the amount of RB is low in the absence of malicious behavior, and grows slowly as a function of the resources expended by the adversary to launch its attack. The outcomes of this research have the potential to secure a broad range of dynamic networks, such as content-sharing systems, e-commerce review platforms, and public-access server settings. This project will foster collaboration between cybersecurity practitioners and academia in the form of two research workshops.  The objectives of this project are also integrated with curriculum development, along with research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Three general application areas are addressed under this project: efficient group maintenance for secure peer-to-peer networks; defending against spam in e-commerce review systems; and cloud-based methods for mitigating denial-of-service attacks. In each area, defenses will be designed that protect critical security invariants at an RB cost to legitimate participants that is scalable: growing slowly with both the RB cost paid by an attacker and the rate at which legitimate participants join and depart the system. To achieve this, the project leverages a novel framework, whereby the amount of adversarial activity is estimated, and then participants are charged an RB cost based on this estimate. This framework can leverage existing machine learning (ML) results to estimate adversarial activity. Importantly, the guarantees provided by these defenses hold over persistent attacks, even with ML error. The theoretical components of this research effort will be complemented by empirical evaluations of the proposed defenses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These ?self-describing? data, file formats, and software libraries, such as HDF5 and netCDF, offer standardized, machine-independent, and portable file formats that support flexible and performant organization of large amounts of data. As a result, numerous scientific, engineering, and industry applications use these formats for storing and analyzing their data. With many critical fields using self-describing formats, these data as well as their corresponding data management software libraries have become critical cyberinfrastructure that must be secured to perform accurate and reproducible science. Unfortunately, existing data management software libraries were designed decades ago, before cybersecurity was a major concern, so there has never been a targeted testing and evaluation of the trustworthiness, integrity, and resilience of these libraries. This project is exploring strategies to integrate both well-known and advanced security algorithms into prominent data management libraries. The research performed in in this project will be a foundational step towards building next generation secure data management cyberinfrastructure for the rapidly changing landscape of science and AI, where security, privacy, and trustworthiness are critically required. <br/><br/>This project will apply comprehensive testing, evaluation, issue identification, hardening, and validation to correct security deficiencies in self-describing file formats and libraries. The specific R&D tasks include: (1) assessing and fixing file format vulnerabilities, (2) protecting data access libraries, (3) exploring security solutions for metadata and data, and (4) constructing a security framework, called S2-D2.

However, the open-source software (OSS) technologies that help facilitate these discoveries often contain thousands of vulnerabilities that, if exploited, could threaten irreplaceable scientific analysis. Since scientific CIs often lack the personnel to manage these vulnerabilities, they increasingly outsource their vulnerability management tasks to third-party Research & Education security providers such as OmniSOC. However, security analysts at these providers often face challenges managing the tens of thousands of vulnerabilities present in OSS assets at CIs. This project scans thousands of scientific CI OSS assets for vulnerabilities and employs novel Artificial Intelligence-enabled analytics to (1) manage OSS asset vulnerabilities in scientific CI and (2) link them to their remediation strategies. Vulnerability scan and analytics results are integrated into a novel Vulnerability Management System that allows security analysts search, sort, browse, and collaborate on vulnerability data and remediation strategies across scientific CIs.<br/><br/>This project designs a novel Artificial Intelligence-enabled AZSecure Usable and Collaborative Security for Science Framework that scans for vulnerabilities in four major categories of open-source software (OSS) assets (virtual machines, containers, infrastructure-as-code, and GitHub) across two major NSF-funded scientific cyberinfrastructures (CIs): (1) CyVerse for life sciences and (2) Jetstream, NSF?s first Science and Engineering Cloud for NSF and NIH. The vulnerability scans support three sets of AI-enabled analytics research thrusts to enhance the usability of vulnerability scan results for OmniSOC?s security analysts. The first thrust aggregates OSS asset and vulnerability data into an embedding for vulnerability management tasks through multi-view learning incorporating a vulnerability severity weighting scheme and a novel combinatorial attention mechanism.

One of the key enablers to achieve this goal is an energy-efficient and ultra-high-data-rate wireless communication system that matches and, at the same time, scales with the data generation rate. Moreover, wireless communication systems are vulnerable to data intrusion with the increasing number of access networks and nodes in dynamic and open communication environments. This forms a big challenge to wireless cybersecurity. Therefore, to satisfy the needs in the Big Data Era, the next generation wireless communication systems with improved energy efficiency and ultra-high data rate while achieving enhanced security is demanded. The research will develop a new reconfigurable and scalable transceiver phased array system, operating at mm-wave to sub-mm-wave frequencies, to achieve these three objectives. To overcome the many performance challenges at such high frequencies, this project will develop several key enabling and new techniques at different design levels, including system configuration, transceiver architecture, and circuit design. The success of this research will advance scientific understanding and create a new design methodology to achieve unparalleled data rates and energy efficiency, which will broadly impact the wireless industry and benefit the society. Moreover, this project will train future engineers and scientists for the fast-growing data-driven industries, with special efforts to promote diversity by training more female and minority students. <br/><br/>The project will develop a reconfigurable and scalable wireless communication system, operating at mm-wave to sub-mm-wave frequencies, that can be efficiently reconfigured into three operation modes: ultra-high data rate for short distance, high data rate for medium distance, and medium data rate for long distance. The array architecture is based on coupled oscillators for high-efficient frequency tuning and beam forming. The unique tuning scheme allows the array size to be scaled effectively for different operation modes to be deployed in different application scenarios without redesigning the whole system. The new direct antenna modulation scheme enables ultra-high data rates and boosts transmitter energy efficiency by mitigating conventional antenna bandwidth constraints and eliminating linear power amplifiers. And the proposed high gain and low noise mixer structure extracts signal phase information to enable high-order demodulation scheme with enhanced receiver noise and gain performance and reduced power consumption. In addition, the proposed redundancy mapping scheme offers secure wireless communications without extra power and communication overheads. If successful, the system's data rate and energy efficiency will be orders of magnitude higher than existing technologies and therefore the new system will open a new door for secure and ultra-high-speed wireless applications. This project will also investigate the design methodologies on how to achieve the highest frequency/speed with the best energy efficiency systematically, from system and circuit levels down to device level. The transformative design methodologies are expected to benefit other wireless applications, such as radar, imaging, and sensing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Students from underrepresented minority groups are involved in research activities.<br/><br/>This project develops Doctor WHO, a CMS analysis framework which combines rapid evidence collection and advanced program analysis techniques for the investigation and remediation of infections and hardening against future CMS compromises. Specifically, the data-driven prediction framework, called TARDIS, is developed to understand the temporal correlation of attack evidence across a corpus of real-world websites. TARDIS enables the automated discovery of the artifacts of a compromise, fingerprinting of the attack's propagation, and rapid investigation of cyberattacks against CMS deployments.

In addition, this project explores novel data-encoding concepts such as fractional bit storage, non-charge based data encoding, and energy-efficient approximate storage techniques that will be critical for the emerging data-intensive applications at the edge. These techniques are tailored to ensure wide applicability, portability and ease of implementation promising to enhance resilience, security, and energy-efficiency of a wide range of future storage solutions.<br/><br/><br/>The project will provide significant benefits to consumers, industry, and U.S. government alike in a wide range of storage applications including edge/cloud data centers and personal storage devices. These techniques will enable system integrators to develop near-term disruptive data-intensive applications such as artificial intelligence and predictive analytics at the edge nodes operating in extreme environments (e.g., nuclear and space). In addition, industrial collaborations will be leveraged for critical feedback and possible commercialization of any relevant techniques developed in this project. The educational and outreach plan includes training graduate and undergraduate students in the area of cybersecurity and advanced storage technologies, conducting annual workshop and summer camps to attract young students, particularly from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will develop theory-backed statistical methods and algorithms to address pressing challenges in the application of classification. These challenges are related to imperfect aspects of training data, which are widespread in high-stake applications such as disease diagnosis and cybersecurity. In particular, this project will focus on the so-called asymmetric classification problems where a particular class is of greater importance than other classes, and the methods and algorithms will aim to control the classification error of missing the most important class in the population, not just in a particular dataset. This property will make the methods and algorithms powerful for medical diagnosis, for which the primary goal is diagnosis accuracy in the population. Moreover, this project will provide a suite of projects, ranging from theory to applications, that are suitable for training graduate and undergraduate students. The interdisciplinary nature of this project is expected to attract students from diverse background to join the PIs? efforts.<br/><br/>The PIs will develop a suite of application-driven, theory-backed methods and algorithms to address pressing data challenges including sample size limitations, sampling biases, and ambiguous class labels. The development will be primarily under the Neyman-Pearson (NP) classification paradigm, which was designed to control the population-level false-negative rate (p-FNR) under a desired level while minimizing the population-level false-positive rate (p-FPR). This project will integrate the NP classification into cutting-edge statistical learning tasks and enable it to address the aforementioned real-world data challenges. Specifically, this project will include the following four overarching goals. First, the PIs will use random matrix theory to address a long-standing problem in the NP classification methodology: whether NP classifiers can be constructed without a sample-splitting step to improve data efficiency. Second, because the NP paradigm has an invariance property to sampling bias, the PIs will develop NP classifiers to address the sampling bias issue in biomedical applications. These classifiers can be trained on biased samples but still achieve the p-FNR control. Third, the PIs will develop a model-free feature ranking framework to incorporate multiple classification paradigms including the NP paradigm and to reflect prediction objectives. Fourth, the PIs will develop the first NP umbrella algorithm under the label noise setting and the first information-theoretic criteria that combine ambiguous classes in multi-class classification. To disseminate the project outcomes, the PIs will give research talks, organize conference sessions, share open-source software packages with tutorials, and reach out to practitioners of classification methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Advances in cloud computing have enabled integration of field-programmable gate-arrays (FPGAs) in high-end platforms for domain-specific customization. However, such FPGA-as-a-service systems are vulnerable to malicious attacks and countermeasures are needed to ensure that these systems can be deployed with high assurance. Today's security solutions are not sufficient for next-generation platforms in which intellectual property (IP) blocks from different providers are integrated on the same FPGA fabric; they access shared computational resources and incorporate applications from potentially untrusted sources. <br/><br/>This research is based on a combination of authentication methods, information flow tracking, shadow logic, formal methods, and the monitoring of on-chip sensors. Machine learning is utilized to detect malicious FPGA bitstreams. Authentication methods are being used to secure FPGAs against denial-of-service attacks due to greedy tenants, task-redirection, task-hiding, and temporal-instance attacks. Shadow logic and information flow tracking are used to secure the FPGA and other IPs against data-sniffing and data-modification attacks. Evaluation is being carried out  using a Digilent Genesys 2 board with an embedded Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA, and a ZedBoard Zynq-7000 development board.<br/><br/>Threat modeling, attack prediction, and proactive countermeasures will contribute to trust assurance in FPGA-as-a-Service systems.

Digital forensics involves the scientific acquisition, authentication, and analysis of digital evidence as it applies to the law. It is used to gather evidence in court cases, aiding in the conviction of criminals, saving lives, and promoting equity and justice. The widespread use of AI in our daily lives and critical systems necessitates an understanding of how to investigate AI failures when they occur. However, little work currently exists in forensics for AI systems in general or shared machine learning models in particular. These shared model formats are important to developing AI-based systems that cross organizational boundaries, providing a practically important starting point for advancing science, practice, and education around digital forensics for AI-based systems. In particular, the work addresses a legal forensic necessity for the admissibility of digital evidence in courts of law that will have a substantial impact on the cybersecurity industry. The success of this initiative will have far-reaching implications for industries that rely heavily on ML models, such as government, finance, healthcare, and transportation, by improving their ability to detect and mitigate potential threats and vulnerabilities.<br/><br/>To achieve this, the project focuses on the field of model forensics, particularly on HDF5 model file forensic parsing, data injection, and provenance attribution. The primary objective is to enhance the current state-of-the-art and develop novel tools and techniques to aid practitioners in analyzing and connecting model files to their respective training systems. The project has three specific aims: (1) Develop and deploy forensic tools for reconstructing HDF5 model files, and assess their precision in data recovery from extensive datasets using benchmark performance indicators; (2) Evaluate data injection and detection methods in HDF5 by implementing a large-scale experiment and assessing performance using established detection and retrieval metrics; and (3) Design and appraise a systematic approach for AI model ballistics (associating a model with its training hardware, software, and data) using standardized testing protocols, reference datasets, and performance criteria to ensure accurate, consistent, and replicable outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To enhance roadway safety and efficiency through driver-assistance and automated-driving systems, cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) is the globally preeminent technology to support connected vehicle services, including vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, and is set for expansion toward 6G cellular technology. In particular, V2V communication that allows vehicles to directly exchange messages beyond the perception range of on-board sensors has many tangible benefits to society with the potential to prevent a significant percentage of crashes, increase transportation system efficiency (reducing travel time, pollution, etc.), and enhance mobility for disadvantaged communities. Despite long-standing classical security protocols designed for C-V2X, however, this technology is vulnerable to imminent quantum attacks from emerging quantum computers threatening the ?integrity? of safety-critical messages, and to denial-of-service attacks at the currently unprepared communication protocols hindering possible mitigations for those quantum attacks. Countering these attacks, separately or jointly, is challenging, a significant risk to the safety of the growing connected vehicle services and future autonomous ones, especially as current hardware (with 12-15 year life expectancy on vehicles) is inefficient at running post-quantum algorithms fast enough.<br/><br/>This CAREER project refines and refocuses existing V2V communication and security protocols, without an overhaul, to support post-quantum algorithms, given the hardware and other practical limitations in the automotive industry. With novel security protocols and backward-compatible communication techniques to prevent, mitigate, and evaluate quantum attacks, this project transforms the current C-V2X ecosystem to become crypto-agile for a staged transition over the next two decades into a quantum-resistant one. The research and education agenda is framed around three thrusts: (1) Establishing a roadmap and a transition plan in designing specific interim security protocols for different stages of the transition (e.g., before and after compatible hardware is available); (2) Supporting post-quantum algorithms by optimizing the resource scheduling techniques at the MAC layer to accommodate more messages, and developing novel message sieving techniques at the physical layer to reduce the integrity verification loads on the security modules; and (3) Developing a unique prototype of a digital twin infused with software-defined radios by converting an open-source V2V security testbed to an interactive platform with interfaces to large-scale (NSF-funded) testbeds. As an integral part of this project, a digital twin will be used (instead of costly urban experiments) for comprehensive evaluation of the proposed techniques and development of a novel game for gamifying connected vehicle security education. It cultivates new interdisciplinary research among game design, wireless security, and the automotive industry, providing for synergistic research and education outcomes, and will also help broaden the impacts through inclusive mobility initiatives for disadvantaged (deaf and hard-of-hearing) communities and innovative educational pathways to train next generation of under-represented cybersecurity experts. The PI will disseminate new course modules, hands-on labs, and the new games through open-access lectures, academic/public exhibits, and various collegiate and K-12 competitions. The research outcomes will be shared with stakeholders for supporting safe innovations, standardization bodies (NIST, IEEE) for security standards, and 3GPP and automotive industry for 6G C-V2X specifications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Nation faces a grave infrastructure challenges in maintaining and upgrading its infrastructure to deliver an adequate standard of service compatible to the expectations of its citizens.   Besides, the prosperity of our communities requires to embrace and erect emerging types of service infrastructure (i.e., autonomous vehicles, connected vehicles, Internet of Things, etc.) to meet modern-day expectations of digital and connected world.  Infrastructure inspection provides important data to support decisions on its management, rehabilitation, and reconstruction plan,  which cost billions of dollars each year. Various infrastructure service sectors conduct routine inspections of their infrastructure conditions (such as road, bridges, culvert, transmission lines, etc.). The infrastructure inspection industry employs tens of thousands workers in the private sector.  The public sectors also maintains in-house workforce to inspect public infrastructure such as interstate highway, bridges, levees, etc.  While there are significant advancement in robotics and information technologies, there are major technical barriers to make them fully integrated to augment human inspection and judgment. Consequently, human inspection remains as the mainstream for information collection across a variety of infrastructure sectors.   This planning grant aims to define the road map towards how robotics and AI-driven techniques can be seamlessly integrated with human inspectors to improve their efficiency, reliability, and safety.  The hypothesis is that the nexus of inspection workers and technology will support sound data-driven infrastructure decisions, and therefore help improve the level of service of the existing infrastructure system as well as better target high payoff futuristic infrastructure investments.  It therefore will explore the frontier of human-technology nexus in domain with high impacts on the welfare of the infrastructure inspection workers as well as on the general public.<br/><br/>The planning activities by this project will implement a number of strategies to build a roadmap for human-robotics integration center upon infrastructure inspection workers. The integrated research theme is defined in the areas of Inspection efficiency and reliability, Inspector safety and cybersecurity, Decision machine in support of inspection decisions, Open framework for public engagement in infrastructure inspection.  A number of planning activities will be implemented including the planning workshops, an interdisciplinary lecture series, regular teleconference meetings, and thrust leaders? convocations.  Stakeholders of infrastructure owners, inspection service providers, community colleges will be involved to provide inputs to refine the roadmap to advance convergence research agenda.  Concerted efforts will be targeting at fostering workforce training and innovation culture.  Besides providing extensive opportunities for dynamic interactions and transdisciplinary engagement, the planning activities will also provide participants with training of essential team science skills.  The effectiveness of the planning activities will be measured by timely collecting feedbacks, which will be incorporated to further improve the planning activities for the best outcomes.  This project will catalyze the integration of robotics and AI-driven techniques to help efficiency and safety of workers during infrastructure inspection, crucial to the sustainability and resilience of our infrastructure system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To sustain and grow our economy, the United States must remain highly competitive in technology and cybersecurity areas. To do so, U. S. students must be educated in computer science principles and computational thinking. This project aims to address this need by increasing the number of STEM-certified teachers who are highly trained in computer science and related areas.  It will do so by providing scholarships, training, and internships to future teachers, as well as by supporting new teachers.  Students majoring or minoring in Computer Science/Cyber Engineering will obtain a minor in secondary education and teaching certification, with an additional computer science certification.  Other STEM majors could complete a new online Computer Science Education Certificate that will be developed by the project.  This certificate would prepare them to infuse computational thinking into related STEM classes and extracurricular activities such as robotics clubs.  Thus, the project will contribute to increasing the number of teachers who will help to prepare a computationally knowledgeable population, as well as the skilled computer science workforce and technology leaders of tomorrow.<br/><br/>This project at Louisiana Tech University includes partnerships with the National Integrated Cyber Education Research Center and six high-need school districts (Bienville Parish, Caddo Parish, Lincoln Parish, Ouachita Parish, Richland Parish, and Winn Parish). The project?s five-year goals include recruiting, preparing, and retaining 20 STEM teachers who are highly trained in computer science principles and who will teach in high-need north Louisiana high schools. The theoretical basis for the project is that, to enable more students to be exposed to computer science principles and computational thinking, more teachers must be trained in these areas. The undergraduate teacher candidates recruited for this scholarship program will include computer science and cyber engineering majors, computer science minors, and any other STEM majors interested in computer science. The project includes a focus on increasing participation of underrepresented groups and will support both undergraduates and in-service teachers. Through evaluation of program elements, resulting number of graduates, and effectiveness of graduates, this project will add to the knowledge base about effective computer science education. Results will be disseminated through newsletters, scholarly journals, conference presentations, press releases, blog posts, and social media. The project?s broader impacts include reaching thousands of Louisiana high school students and improving the infrastructure of computer science education and development of STEM teachers, especially in states with extreme shortages in computer science-trained STEM teachers.

Importance of anomaly detection lies in the fact that an anomaly in the observed data may be a sign of an unwanted and often actionable event such as failure, malicious activity, etc. in the underlying system. In many real-time systems, timely and accurate detection of abnormal data patterns is crucial, and will allow proper countermeasures to be taken in a timely manner, to counteract any possible harm. Although anomaly detection has long been studied, today's complex networks exhibit new challenges, such as: low latency requirements, data size, system dynamics, unknown distributions, distributed nature, and privacy. The objective of this proposal is to investigate effective and scalable approaches for real-time data-driven anomaly detection in complex systems with these challenges. The main themes of this proposal address multiple important problems in the early detection of anomalies and attacks in a general complex network setting. Considering the importance of cybersecurity in today's world, methodologies to understand and forewarn changes in the organizational dynamics of such complicated networks is of immense significance. This proposal directly addresses these issues by bringing a fresh and novel set of engineering tools and ideas.<br/><br/>Following a systematic approach, this project first considers (1) how to timely detect anomalies in centralized high-dimensional systems with dynamicity and hidden anomaly challenges; (ii) how to deal with resource constraints in monitoring distributed systems; and (iii) how to enable privacy-preserving solutions for real-time anomaly detection in distributed systems. These challenges and the solution methods presented in this project are generally applicable to a variety of complex systems. To be specific, this project focuses on two challenging IoT networks: surveillance camera network and smart home network. The proposed approaches exploit an array of advanced techniques including sequential change detection, deep reinforcement learning, event-triggered processing, and differential privacy, and will bring significant innovations to the theory and applications of anomaly detection.

However, machine learning is also vulnerable to novel and sophisticated privacy attacks that leak information about the data used for learning and prediction. For example, by accessing the prediction results of a machine learning model that discovers the genetic basis of a particular disease, the privacy attack can infer if a certain patient's clinical record was used to train this model. The privacy attack can be discriminatory in the sense that it has a higher successful rate for certain demographic groups (e.g., females) than the other groups (e.g., males). However, none of the existing defense mechanisms against these attacks consider such disparate vulnerability and thus perform disparate efforts across different groups. This raises the serious concern of fair privacy, i.e., how to ensure all groups and individuals are protected equitably?<br/><br/>This project will address the core issues of fair privacy from both technical and social perspectives. The project has five research thrusts: (1) formalizing the concept of fair privacy quantitatively; (2) unveiling the existence of disparate vulnerability to two popularly-studied, machine learning enabled privacy attacks, namely membership inference attack (MIA) and attribute inference attack (AIA),  and investigating the underlying causes of such vulnerability unfairness; (3) examining the fairness of the existing defense mechanisms against MIA and AIA, and studying how these defense mechanisms affect vulnerability unfairness; (4) designing effective mitigation mechanisms that enable the defense mechanisms to provide equitable protection against MIA and AIA; and (5) performing extensive social studies to explore important social issues related to fair privacy, and utilizing social science to shape the research of fair privacy. The research outcomes will be disseminated broadly through the development of new courses for both STEM and social sciences curricula, involving students into research through various events and student societies. Students at different levels in both disciplines of STEM and liberal arts will be exposed to cutting-edge research in security, privacy, and machine learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But it also incurs on a range of security concerns. As IoT devices may gather geographical information, monitor users? privacy activities, and record clients? biometric features, one of the critical concerns is how to preserve the confidentiality of such sensitive-data traffic when IoT devices communicate with others. Specifically, due to the broadcast nature of wireless signals, conversations between IoT devices are vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks. This project aims to enforce security in devices that cannot afford cryptography operations. In particular, the project will develop a lightweight channel-aware security design that can deliver information securely and is suitable for implementation in resource-limited IoT devices. The scheme will be fined-grained and not protocol-oriented. It is potentially compatible with all existing wireless standards (e.g., WiFi 6, Zigbee, Bluetooth, 5G) and can accommodate diverse requirements of different wireless networks (e.g. cellular network, Wi-Fi network, satellite communication). In addition, the scheme developed will be useful beyond IoT applications. It can be deployed over any network featured with wireless connectivity, especially for those lacking key management infrastructures. In addition, the scheme can work together with cryptography algorithms on the application layer to provide cross-layer security guarantee. Beyond that, educational activities are an integral part of this project, the PI plans to share the outcomes of this project into his courses to motivate more students to get involved in cybersecurity research. The PI will also actively participate in outreach activities to increase the participation, activities, and engagement of students from diverse groups in the community.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to propose an effective and light-weight security design that takes advantage of dynamic signal variation in wireless context to protect sensitive network traffic emanating from IoT devices. The scheme can achieve information-theoretical security and is suitable for implementation in low-cost IoT devices where limited energy and circuitry can be dedicated for security. Specifically, the proposed scheme aims to exploit the inherited randomness feature of communication channels to achieve confidentiality of sensitive data without key distribution and management. In addition, the project plans to employ security design into relatively simple baseband processing procedures, which incur less overhead and only consume a very limited amount of resources. The project will focus on investigating important research problems associated with the proposed channel-aware security design using analytical modeling, comprehensive simulations, and experimental evaluations. In particular, the project aims to 1) identify practical issues towards the implementation of the proposed scheme and developing techniques that address the issues; 2) validate and refine the design via a thorough theoretical analysis and comprehensive simulations; and 3) build a practical wireless environment and systematically evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability of the proposed design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project adds new models to the literature that draw from integer programming, multi-stage stochastic programming, adversarial risk analysis, and network games. Solving these models is extremely challenging, and therefore, this research explores new algorithmic techniques to identify optimal and near-optimal model solutions.

The goal of this research is to educate teens on safe, responsible, and ethical conduct on the internet through Social Media Co-Pilot, an innovative AI-based conversational intervention embedded in an interactive and realistic online learning environment. By dynamically analyzing learners? input, the Co-Pilot will identify ?teachable moments? and offer personalized, conversational feedback to reinforce prosocial behaviors and discourage risky actions online. With the capacity to assume different conversational roles appropriate to the situation (e.g., a more knowledgeable peer, a peer needing immediate help, an adult mentor etc.), Social Media Co-Pilot will guide a learner into a deeper reflection and responsible actions when confronting common social media risks and pitfalls, such as online aggression, privacy violation, phishing, and scams. This project will benefit all youth, but will provide additional, customized support to vulnerable and underserved communities, thus reducing digital divides. Youth?s improved digital literacy and cyber safety skills can provide a foundation for STEM literacy and enhance their readiness to pursue STEM careers. <br/><br/>The PIs will employ cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) techniques to develop the conversational agent that drives Social Media Co-Pilot. They will iteratively refine Social Media Co-Pilot with teens and educators, whose formative feedback will inform incremental improvement of the tool and provide personalized in-situ conversations and critical reflection on various cybersecurity challenges. Co-Pilot will be developed using large language models with extensive input from racially and ethnically diverse teens and educators to ensure its relevance to different learners, as well as its effectiveness and scalability. Once built, PIs will evaluate the effects of Social Media Co-Pilot on youth?s cyber safety knowledge and behavioral outcomes through a randomized field experiment. By leveraging educational theories to inform improvements in the design and evaluation of Social Media Co-Pilot, this project will contribute new knowledge about the effectiveness of AI-based conversational agents as experiential learning tools.

The newly developed CI enables searches that can uncover ?unknown? physics through rare, unpredictable phenomena. Traditionally, discoveries of rare processes through particle and astro-particle experiments have relied on scientists? ability to accurately predict new physics phenomena, and to subsequently selectively look for them within the data by using algorithms trained on predicted unknowns. In a new era of scientific discovery, driven by unprecedented data statistics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) advances, scientists instead may now use AI-powered tools that let the data guide expectation to selectively identify rare and unpredictable signatures that may lie within the data itself, and which may be signatures of new fundamental physics phenomena in nature. The project brings together physicists and computer scientists at Columbia and Princeton, including students, post-doctoral researchers, and CI professionals, and additional collaborators at other US institutions and national labs, to develop anomaly detection algorithms that are executable on resource constrained platforms, commonly employed as on-detector data processing devices at particle physics experiments. Through targeted developments and demonstrations at existing particle detector facilities, the ultimate goal of this project is to develop advanced CI that is energy-efficient, reliable, scalable, and expandable, and thus applicable to trigger systems of current and future generation experiments in the intensity, energy, and cosmic frontiers of particle physics. By design, the delivered CI is capable of fundamental discoveries that are beyond what is envisioned with current trigger frameworks, and has the potential of revolutionizing the way particle and astro-particle physics discoveries are made. The developed CI promises to be broadly applicable to other high-throughput data-selection applications that require real-time, intelligent data processing for the purposes of discovering anomalies in data. These applications can range from neuroscience, to medical imaging, to satellite imaging, cybersecurity, etc.<br/><br/>This award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Physics at the Information Frontier in the Division of Physics within the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

According to Google?s Project Zero, a new exploit is discovered in the wild every 17 days, although it takes an average of 15 days across all vendors to patch a vulnerability, highlighting the inability of existing solutions to scale with the rapidly evolving threat landscape. This project takes a radically new approach by developing a holistic security-centric hardware/software stack that is decoupled from the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), so as to empower software to dynamically push expressive security policies to hardware, where they can be transparently and efficiently enforced on-demand and in-the-field through novel hardware design mechanisms, without the need for recompilation, redeployment, and frequent hardware upgrades. This work is expected to significantly enhance robustness, versatility, flexibility, and adaptability of modern architectures in the range and types of exploits they can mitigate, while simultaneously minimizing both the time to mitigation and the cost of deployment. This project will also address the urgent need to boost the nation?s cybersecurity workforce through (a) curriculum development and ethical hacking workshops targeted at high school, college, and professional students, (b) development of community research infrastructure and evaluation testbeds for rapid assessment of security policies, and (c) research mentorship of undergraduate and underrepresented students on security-related projects. <br/><br/>This project entails three synergistic research thrusts that together enable a holistic full system across-the-stack solution for timely mitigation of exploits. The first thrust will develop a decoupled security-centric hardware/software interface to allow software to capture interactions and relationships among the different subjects and objects in the system and specify an expressive set of security policies in the form of logic formulas, to mitigate a wide range of hardware and software attacks ranging from memory and type safety to transient execution attacks. The second thrust will develop novel hardware design mechanisms and microcode primitives to evaluate and enforce the security policies specified in software, while maintaining high levels of performance with minimal impact on power and area. The third thrust will develop innovative hardware-based attribute tracking mechanisms to transparently track the flow of high-level software attributes, during execution, to enhance the effectiveness of the underlying hardware enforcement mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the foreseeable future, human inputs and interventions will still be necessary, at least as a monitor or supervisor in AVs. Monitoring to correctly detect rare but potentially deadly events in AVs requires high levels of vigilance.  The required vigilance taxes human supervisors in AVs. This project aims to overcome these challenges through novel collaboration between the AI system and the human driver. This project will result in algorithms and design principles that help reduce road accidents and are broadly applicable to other related intelligent systems in critical areas such as cybersecurity, national defense, and healthcare. Moreover, this project will support multi-disciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students across disciplines, the development of course modules that provide students interdisciplinary experience critical to shaping the regional and national workforce, and involvement of underrepresented students in STEM fields at the graduate, undergraduate, and pre-K through 12 levels.  <br/><br/>This project addresses safety-critical challenges by developing a cognizant human-in-the-loop secure AI mechanism. The project focuses on autonomous driving incorporating three thrusts: (1) Investigate how to maintain human drivers' vigilance through secondary task assignments that incorporate the level of uncertainty in the AI decisions,  (2) Develop a fault-tolerant, adversary-aware AI engine that outputs uncertainty levels in its decision as a basis for requesting human inputs.  (3) Develop a vigilance-based adaptive task-allocation scheme to calibrate human vigilance online based on a quantitative vigilance model constructed from human-subject data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Future cyberattacks on connected and automated vehicles will necessitate the study and development of novel countermeasures to increase market acceptance of these vehicle technologies, which could improve traffic conditions, vehicle and personal safety, and energy efficiency. This award will contribute to the intellectual development of underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students in modeling, Artificial Intelligence, and communication to address cybersecurity issues in connected autonomous vehicles. The prime objective of this research is to create a defense technique that will enable Connected Autonomous Vehicles to be more resistant to adversarial attacks and hence capable of meeting more stringent safety and performance requirements. Another key focus is to involve teams of undergraduate and graduate students in creative inquiry and design projects based on hands-on demo platforms. This research focuses especially on enhancing the resilience of Connected Autonomous Vehicles against the possibility of adversarial attacks aimed at affecting the performance of the perception module, thereby improving vehicle reliability and functional safety beyond currently adopted practices. In addition, the award has larger theoretical implications in the fields of security, Machine Learning, filtering, and optimization, ultimately expediting the deployment of connected autonomous vehicles.<br/><br/>Recent advancements in connected and autonomous vehicles reveal that several companies are investing substantially in the development of perception modules based on machine learning algorithms. However, these machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial attacks designed to mislead the input of the deep neural network to induce a misclassification, which may undermine vehicle decision-making and, therefore, functional safety. Through wireless Ethernet connectivity, attackers may compromise the in-vehicle computer platform and obtain access to the sensor data stored in memory. Before the perception module, adversarial inputs may be introduced to supplant the original normal inputs and destabilize vehicle operations. The overall framework comprises modeling potential adversarial threats impacting the perception and fusion process and designing both reactive and proactive countermeasures for the secure and reliable functioning of the system. This technique is modular and can be deployed to a range of Deep Neural Network applications such as robotics, biometric identification, and speech recognition. Incorporating robustness measures during the training phase will yield a more resilient Deep Neural Network. Moreover, filtering at several stages of the perceptron process can be used to develop a system that can innately tolerate a greater spectrum of attacks. The project tasks aim at conducting fundamental research on a plan that includes adversarial attack modeling for single and fused sensor data, novel data filtering algorithms for detecting various white-box and black-box attacks, revised Deep Neural Network training based on robustness/sensitivity tradeoff in optimization models, evaluation of the impact of sensor fusion, and testing the framework on F1/10 cars and autonomous golf cars.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Support will be in the form of scholarships and extensive supports that address their specific needs by strengthening their social capital through stronger relationships with their faculty and fellow students and by engaging in community service. Over its six-year duration, this project will fund scholarships for 24 full-time students who are pursuing bachelor?s degrees in majors such as Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Information Technology, Game Design Development, and Cybersecurity. Scholars will be selected as first-year students and will receive scholarships for up to four years. Specific project activities include a pre-fall program that will focus on refreshing scholars? math foundation, math tutoring, cohort building, faculty mentoring, lab workshops centered around game controller design, electronic puzzles, or 3D printing, career guidance for scholars and community engagement with STEM organizations. For community engagement, scholars will participate in internships to work with several community partners in Bridgeport, Connecticut that offer learning opportunities after school and in the summer to low-income K-12 students. This project will examine how the internships will impact scholars? STEM identity and attitudes regarding social justice and service-learning over time, how they impact academic performance and how scholars? personalities change over the duration of the six-year program.<br/><br/>There will be three cohorts of eight students per cohort for a total of 24 unique scholars and 96 unique scholarships. Through the aforementioned scholarships and supports, Sacred Heart University will provide the means for low-income, talented scholars with financial need to persist in their major to graduation and support its scholars in their preparation to pursue positions in the workforce or to successfully advance to graduate school. The program has the following four objectives: (1) Decrease the drop-fail-withdraw rates for foundational mathematics courses and increase the first-year retention of scholars retained in their STEM majors; (2) Increase the four-year graduation rate for scholars in any of the S-STEM targeted majors; (3) Increase the number of scholars placed in a paid summer internship as a rising senior at regional companies and place scholars in a STEM position in the workforce or a graduate school program within six months of graduation. SHU has a longstanding tradition of service-learning in underserved communities and thus added a fourth objective: (4) Explore the impact of community engagement by giving scholars the opportunity to apply STEM concepts in communities of need. Each student will reach 200 hours per summer or winter break of community-focused, paid internship per scholar in their first and second years in their program.

A challenge that is often ignored, however, is the adversarial nature of many domains, in which social, economic, and political interests may try to manipulate intelligent systems into making costly mistakes.  While AI has a long history in playing adversarial games, such as chess and poker, the approaches have not been appropriate for many real-world situations.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop a general framework for adversarial AI that is far broader in scope and applicability, building on insights from game theory, AI planning, and cybersecurity.<br/><br/>A key modeling insight of the proposed research is that attacks across a broad array of settings can be modeled as planning problems, so that robust algorithms can be fundamentally viewed as interdicting attack plans.  Our research will develop new foundational techniques for scalable plan interdiction under uncertainty, building off of the framework of Stackelberg games. Proposed techniques will leverage a combination of abstraction, factored representation of state, and value function approximation.  In addition, novel scalable algorithms will be developed for multi-stage interdiction problems, modeled as sequential stochastic games, considering both perfect and imperfect information. Moreover, the research will make novel modeling and algorithmic contributions in multi-defender and multi-attacker interdiction games.  Finally, in the more applied arena, the research will make significant intellectual contributions in applying advances in adversarial AI to model problems exhibiting important adversarial aspects, such as privacy-preserving data sharing, access control and audit policies, and vaccine design.<br/>"

ACES (Accelerating Computing for Emerging Sciences), an innovative advanced computational prototype to be developed by Texas A&M University, tries to answer a fundamental question: how does one effectively offer a holistic computing platform that can simultaneously meet the needs of a continuum of users in diverse research communities with varying levels of computing adoption? The project will allow researchers to creatively develop new programming models and workflows that utilize these architectures while simultaneously advancing HPC (High Performance Computing) and data science projects.<br/><br/>The ACES platform removes significant bottlenecks in advanced computing by introducing the flexibility to aggregate various components (i.e., processors, accelerators and memory) on an as-needed basis to solve problems that were previously not addressable. By letting researchers switch and run on accelerators best suited for their workflows, ACES will benefit many research and development projects in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), cybersecurity, health population informatics, genomics and bioinformatics, human and agricultural life sciences, oil & gas simulations, de novo materials design, climate modeling, molecular dynamics, quantum computing architectures, imaging, smart and connected societies, geosciences, and quantum chemistry. Toward facilitating researcher use, ACES will offer avenues for interactive computing, portals, and cloud connectivity. ACES will support the national research community through coordination systems supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF).  Finally, ACES will also leverage existing efforts that promote science and broaden participation in computing at the K-12, collegiate, and professional levels to have a transformative impact nationally by focusing on training, education and outreach. ACES activities are designed to expand the participation of traditionally underrepresented groups in computing and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), particularly at minority-serving institutions. ACES will offer fellowships to students, continue efforts to support teacher programs, and offer a number of formal and informal courses, whose materials will be offered to the national community for use free-of-charge.<br/><br/>This project funds the development of a dynamically composable high-performance data analysis and computing platform, named ACES.  AI and ML are integrated with traditional simulation and modeling approaches in the pursuit of innovation. Edge-computing and instrumental probes have pushed the need to verify, process, store, analyze, and query vast amounts of unstructured data in real time. The coupling of analytics with closely-situated data on highly-usable web-based technologies connected to a compute backend have led to a paradigm shift in expectations from research computing environments. The ACES innovative composable hardware platform helps accelerate transformative changes in research areas that can leverage novel High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) processors and accelerators for analytics and computing.

Different data sources may have data in different formats, structures, and schema, and a significant challenge in integrating such diverse sources of data streams is the interoperability.

TR2 is a pioneering attempt to bridge the gap between neural embedding based modern AI that has proven to be effective and comprehensive and interpretable analytics of temporal and streaming data. The results will impact domains that make use of temporal and streaming data, such as healthcare, banking and finance, cybersecurity, social network analysis, mobile and pervasive computing, and sensor monitoring for various purposes.<br/><br/>TR2 aims to advance the frontier of data stream and temporal data management systems by leveraging modern relational machine learning and representation learning. It is also a generalization and extension of previous work in triple stores, functional dependency, active databases, complex event processing, predictive queries, and rule/knowledge systems, in a novel holistic data system, all tightly woven through the threads of coding and relational machine learning. TR2 incorporates the following four key new ideas: (1) flexible integration of streams from multiple sources as temporal relational triples, (2) introducing coding using relational machine learning as a major component of TR2, and extending data with predicted counterparts for comprehensive queries, (3) learning higher-level rules and knowledge with coding, which are useful for interpretation and probabilistic inference, and (4) extracting higher-level states and patterns for continuously monitoring the imminence of critical events and for choosing actions.

In addition, the current educational disruption caused by COVID-19 provides the important and unique opportunity to determine what effect, if any, the resulting educational changes have had on participation of different groups of students in computer science. Students from underrepresented groups appear to have encountered greater difficulty accessing distance learning and being connected to the full range of educational opportunities presented by these unique circumstances, which are very strongly related to technological know-how. There is legitimate cause for concern that the pandemic will further divide the advantaged from the disadvantaged, further marginalizing the underrepresented groups that the project is studying from opportunities to advance into computer science majors and progress successfully through them. Computer science is an area of critical strategic importance for the nation, and a field in which cultivating domestic talent can have enormous impact.  Thus, examining pre- and post- pandemic patterns of participation in computer science have the potential to help the nation meet its growing needs for talent in computer science and related fields, such as cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. <br/><br/>This study will use a large, rich data set compiled from ten years of undergraduate application, admissions, and course-level data from four institutions:  Loyola Marymount University, Cal State University Long Beach, the University of California Riverside, and the University of California San Diego.  Analysis of these longitudinal data will improve understanding of who has access, who applies, who is admitted, and who succeeds in computer science. Using classical statistical approaches and modern machine learning based approaches to analysis of large data sets, the study seeks to understand how to improve the inclusion of all students in computer science. It will supplement this large-scale quantitative analysis with qualitative analysis of results from targeted focus-groups and interviews.  The qualitative analysis, coupled with the quantitative analysis of longitudinal data from four institutions with different student demographics and other characteristics, will provide a deeper analysis of access to and success in computer science than any previous study.  The resulting extension of knowledge has the potential to lay the foundation for achieving equitable access to computer science education for all students. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Learning computer science is critical for 1) individual professional success as more technical and STEM jobs require computer science knowledge, 2) individual personal success as digital literacy and personal cybersecurity are increasingly required to competently interact via technology, and 3) societal and workforce success as industries leverage computing to solve problems. However, there are significant barriers to everyone learning foundational computer science in the university education system. First, there are a limited number of professors with computer science knowledge, especially outside of computer science departments, to teach these skills. Second, a large portion of the population is underrepresented in computer science, including girls and women, people who are not White or Asian, and people from lower-income families. This project aims to address both barriers by integrating computer science education into teacher preparation programs. Many future teachers represent groups who are underrepresented in computer science and, currently, less than 5% of colleges of education have faculty with computer science knowledge. This project will develop and examine a system for teacher preparation programs that trains education faculty to incorporate and customize existing, evidence-based resources that teach and apply computer science skills to teaching in non-computer-science fields, like English, math, and science. Many of these resources have been developed with NSF support, but education faculty need help applying them to their programs. Thus, this project aims to broaden participation in computing by leveraging existing resources to help teachers integrate computing into their instructional toolkit. It also has significant benefits for teachers? future students, who will learn computer science as part of their required courses, such as English, math, and science.<br/> <br/>This Computing in Undergraduate Education Transformation track project addresses the integration of computing in colleges of education, particularly in non-CS teacher preparation programs. The project builds on past work supported by NSF grants #1941642 and #2016010 at Georgia State University, where the project team integrated computing into all teacher preparation programs across disciplines and grades. That work found that teachers quickly recognize computing as a powerful tool for teaching non-CS learning objectives in their future classrooms when CS education faculty collaborate with teacher preparation faculty to make computing solutions that serve their needs. In this project, Georgia State faculty will work with teacher preparation faculty and approximately 1,500 teachers in four colleges of education to develop and pilot a replicable system for colleges of education to incorporate and customize existing resources for computing integration in teacher preparation programs that serve their teachers? needs. This project focuses on benefits for future teachers in their undergraduate programs to understand 1) how can we adapt and apply existing, external computing education resources to be sustainably integrated into teacher education curricula for future K-12 teachers and 2) what types of knowledge and skills (e.g., content, pedagogical, policy, standards) do teacher education faculty need to sustainably support computing integration? To answer these questions, the project will use a design-based research approach, which draws from both prospective experimental methodologies and reflective ethnographic methodologies to balance rigor and responsivity to local university and policy landscapes. Project staff will collect data from a variety of sources including artifacts, discussion boards, assessments, and surveys. Our primary goal is to enable future, primarily non-CS, teachers to use computing as a powerful pedagogical tool in their classrooms, ultimately preparing a more diverse range of people to use computing across a variety of contexts and challenging problems. In addition, this goal has upstream effects, by enabling the faculty in teacher preparation programs to use computing in their programs, and downstream effects, by giving K-12 students experiences with computing across the curriculum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlike conventional side-channel vulnerabilities, the electromagnetic (EM) side-channel emission leaks information over wireless channel, offering a unique medium to investigate IoT security without accessing or instrumenting the device. Unfortunately, current research on the EM side-channel attacks of IoT devices has been severely limited by the lack of a practical sensing system that can extract weak EM signals emitted by computer processors or memories, separate those EM signals of co-located devices, and robustly unravel their semantics. To tackle these challenges, this project will design, implement, and evaluate a practical EM sensing system named EMRadar to enable research on EM side-channel attacks and defenses in real environments. The results of this project will deepen our understanding of EM side-channel attacks and inform emission security standards. Practical EM side-channel defenses enabled by this project will transform various security-critical IoT applications, including detecting program deviations in medical devices that are highly resource-constrained, such as the implantable cardiac devices and the smart insulin pumps. The project is dedicated to fostering diversity and inclusion in STEM by blending research with education and outreach activities. The PI will actively involve local high school students by providing hands-on activities and presentations elucidating fundamental concepts of IoT technologies and cybersecurity. To bridge the gap in STEM participation, the project will engage students from underrepresented minority groups in Detroit and Pontiac as well as various Michigan-based organizations for girls. This endeavor is supported by collaborations with the Oakland University's STEM summer camps and field trips, as well as the Michigan Aspirations in Computing Committee. Through these initiatives, the project will inspire a broad spectrum of students to pursue futures in engineering and science.<br/><br/>This project will design, implement, and evaluate the EMRadar, a practical EM sensing system that enables research on EM side-channel attacks and defenses in realistic environments. The proposed research will build on a three-layer architecture model. (1) In the sensing layer, EMRadar will incorporate innovative signal processing techniques to extract weak EM signals that are deeply buried in noise and contaminated by interference. To achieve this, the EMRadar will exploit the unique characteristics of EM emissions from a processor or memory and IoT software behavior, enabling novel methods that can adapt and optimize signal processing techniques used in classic Radar systems for highly sensitive EM sensing. (2) In the representation layer, this project will explore universal representation and classification of EM signals to unravel EM side-channel emissions of processors and memories. Despite extensive studies on EM side-channel emissions, accurate explanation of the semantics of EM side-channel signals remains highly challenging due to significant variation of EM signal pattern and the EM interference produced by workloads running on the same device. This project will leverage the recent advances in time series analysis and machine learning to revisit the representation of EM signals, and conduct a systematic measurement study to understand the robustness of universal representation across IoT devices with different architectures. (3) In the application layer, the EMRadar will be evaluated in real-world setups and applications. The PI will collaborate with domain experts to explore applications of the system developed in this project, such as supporting efficient IoT-based applications in healthcare, automobile industry, and intelligent buildings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, this rapidly evolving technology has introduced new cybersecurity threats that could significantly undermine voice system security. For example, the criminal exploitation of AI technologies has led to the advent of audio deepfakes that can be used to circumvent speaker verification protocols in banking systems. This project addresses AI-driven attacks through a comprehensive exploration of audio attack strategies and the development of a defensive framework to strengthen recognition performance and counteract these attacks.

Thus, improving network resiliency, transparency, and cybersecurity have emerged as a national priority. Smart Manufacturing technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning show promise in achieving these objectives, yet struggle to materialize at the manufacturing network level. Particularly small and medium-sized manufacturers struggle in their adoption of these data-driven, value added technologies due to a lack of resources and incentives. Consequently, they cannot participate in many high-value manufacturing networks that often require certain technologies and data sharing. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project supports research that intends to address this challenge through a Blockchain-enabled framework that leverages secure and private Federated Learning which meets the unique requirements of defense manufacturing networks. This framework enhances the availability and integrity of critical supplies, as well as strengthens and diversifies the defense industrial base. The project?s secure and privacy-preserving data sharing and collaboration mechanisms can be applied in various domains beyond manufacturing, such as healthcare, finance, and supply chain, empowering individuals and organizations to share data securely and collaborate effectively. The results have potential to transform industry, drive economic growth, foster innovation, and enhance societal well-being. <br/><br/>The project?s research problem stems from manufacturing networks? inability to securely and efficiently exchange data and leverage network level Federated Learning. The project aims to increase the resiliency of distributed and dynamic manufacturing networks, specifically including small and medium-sized manufacturers, by providing access to a secure private Blockchain platform that enables decentralized, secure, and transparent communication channels. This enables manufacturing network level learning through Federated Learning while respecting data ownership and ensuring retention of competitive or controlled (raw) data and machine learning models. To achieve these goals, the project utilizes Federated Learning by integrating a private Blockchain to manage metadata, access controls, and model updates. Unlike existing approaches, the framework focuses on specific challenges and requirements of manufacturing networks. This means ensuring confidential data remains local under full control of the individual nodes while leveraging Blockchain for efficient coordination of the Federated Learning process as well as reducing overhead cost for smaller network participants that are resource constraint. The project advances the state-of-the-art in Federated Learning and Blockchain technology through efficient algorithms for model aggregation and coordination in the presence of heterogeneous data for manufacturing networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A comprehensive project website will be created for project papers, reports, presentations, and links to relevant resources, providing a centralized repository of information and resources. The project?s outcomes, including the developed methods and software, will be widely disseminated for public use.<br/><br/>The investigators will develop a dynamic matrix factor model for count series, which leverages a generalized linear factor model to reduce dimensionality and the dependence of the latent factor process to make forecasts. They also will develop a generalized matrix autoregressive model specifically tailored to low dimensional series (e.g., regional special events). The recently introduced repro-samples approach for irregular inference problems are used to assess model uncertainty. Given the complexity of the data, combining different models that better predict different parts of the data is beneficial. Two model averaging schemes are used by combining predictive distributions and dependent p-values, both of which come with uncertainty quantification.

This project focuses on the development of novel transfer learning (TL) frameworks for dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) to enable knowledge transfer across users, environments, and wireless systems, offering viable approaches to intelligently utilize underutilized licensed spectrum more effectively. DSS wireless systems exhibit characteristics such as dynamic environments, heterogeneous networks, massive connections, interference, high communication overhead, limited computing and storage capacity, as well as security and privacy concerns, making it challenging to learn and leverage transferable knowledge. Moreover, achieving the desired performance of knowledge transfer often requires substantial amounts of high-quality training data, while transferring data knowledge may raise security and privacy issues, limiting adaptation and generalization to other tasks. Therefore, this project aims to explore novel TL strategies for learning transferable knowledge and addressing concerns related to robustness, efficiency, security, and privacy in DSS systems. <br/> <br/>A key thrust of the project involves a systematic investigation into the characteristics and parameters of target DSS wireless systems, alongside an exploration of the fundamental principles, theories, and unique challenges associated with knowledge transfer. These studies aim to bridge the gap between system characteristics and algorithm development. The research tasks include the following: (1) Design an ensemble evaluation scheme to assess the robustness, efficiency, security, and privacy of TL-based DSS frameworks. (2) Develop efficient TL-based DSS frameworks for adaptive spectrum sensing, selection, access, and handoff. (3) Create robust security and privacy TL strategies for monitoring, detecting, mitigating, and preventing various malicious attacks, while also protecting sensitive data. Concurrently, the research team is developing a Wireless Knowledge Transfer testbed that incorporates transferable knowledge, evaluation schemes, pre-trained TL models, attack knowledge databases, and security and privacy strategies. This testbed helps to facilitate and standardize research on knowledge reuse in wireless communication systems.

Despite their obvious importance, concurrent abstraction layers have not been treated formally. In 2016, the investigator and his team developed CCAL---a fully mechanized programming toolkit (in Coq) for building certified concurrent abstraction layers. They also applied it to build Certified OS Kernels (CertiKOS), the world's first fully certified concurrent Operating System (OS) kernel. CCAL, however, does not support the general composition of linearizable concurrent objects. It focuses on atomicity but many concurrent libraries do not have sequential atomic specification. This significantly limits CCAL's power and applicability in verifying realistic concurrent OS kernels. This project aims to develop a novel compositional theory of linearizability and a new CCAL toolkit that addresses all of the previous shortcomings. The project's novelties also include new semantic models and formal frameworks for supporting compositional specification, abstraction, and refinement of concurrent programs. The project's impacts include a new set of technologies for building reliable concurrent operating systems, which in turn facilitates the construction of large-scale secure system infrastructures and improves the cybersecurity of our society in general.<br/><br/>More specifically, the project will make several related scientific contributions regarding the theory and practice of linearizability, the gold standard for reasoning about correctness of concurrent objects and supporting compositional verification of concurrent programs. First, it will contribute a novel and significantly generalized compositional theory of linearizability that goes much beyond atomicity and can support realistic threading models (containing multiple Central Processing Unit (CPU) cores, kernel/user-level threads, and hardware devices with interrupts), liveness reasoning, crash-safe concurrency, and weak consistency models. Second, basing upon these new compositional semantic models, it will develop and implement various compositional program logics to verify both the safety and progress properties of concurrent objects with support to blocking concurrency, system crashes, and weak memory models. Third, it will implement and integrate the new theory and program logics into the new CCAL toolkit and apply it to verify advanced kernel synchronization libraries and build realistic compositional concurrent OS kernels and hypervisors. On the educational side, this project will develop new courses on certified system software and formal verification. Artifacts resulting from the project will be made open source to ensure rapid dissemination of ideas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigator plans to develop new approaches and the underlying theory for online machine learning in the context of game theory and partial differential equations that have a range of applications, including finance, medicine, and spam detection. Furthermore, in collaboration with biomedical researchers, the investigator will analyze the performance of algorithms for predicting unknown medical data from images of the human body, which is used in obesity, metabolism, and nutrition research. Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained on some of the latest machine learning algorithms as part of this project, preparing them for careers both in research and in industry jobs. <br/><br/>A fundamental challenge in online machine learning is the increasing complexity of existing algorithms' implementations. Furthermore, most algorithms are not tailored to specific use cases and thus provide suboptimal solutions. This work will provide alternatives to the currently existing online machine learning approaches by introducing ideas and techniques from partial differential equations and optimal control theory. By targeting specific models and using scaling limits, these continuous methods are expected to provide a new framework to find and analyze novel, proved-to-be-optimal algorithms for big data. This research involves a novel approach for using continuous tools to solve discrete problems, providing a fresh view on classically discrete frameworks. A novel game-theoretic interpretation of the optimal strategies can also inform properties of the corresponding partial differential equation solution. This work also entails the analysis of biomedical data using various regression, supervised learning, and semi-supervised learning techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This NSF CAREER project aims to bolster the nation?s grid decarbonization and energy security by developing a grid-edge resource (GER) management framework to increase power system flexibility. The project will bring transformative changes to GER management by overcoming three intertwined challenges, i.e., high scalability requirements, major privacy concerns, and surging cybersecurity risks. This will be achieved by synthesizing ideas from optimization, machine learning, statistics, and cryptology to establish an efficient, private, and secure GER control framework. The intellectual merits of the project include (1) developing a scalable framework that enables efficient cooperative control of heterogeneous GERs; (2) investigating privacy preservation measures for strongly coupled decentralized GER control; (3) investigating models, and detection and mitigation strategies of stealthy cyber-attacks that target at decentralized GER control algorithms. The broader impacts of the project include (1) unleashing heterogeneous GERs to enhance grid reliability and deepen grid decarbonization; (2) advancing the grid?s ability to integrate increasing amounts of renewable generation and GERs in a cost-effective, secure, and reliable way; (3) providing the industry with insight into developing new market products. The integrated education plan will spread control and power system concepts to youth-in-custody, K-12 students, and underrepresented groups, motivating them to pursue STEM education and careers. <br/><br/>Existing GER control frameworks may fail in large-scale deployment because they invariably ignore scalability issues caused by network dimension and GER heterogeneity, lack efficient measures to protect GER owners? privacy, and lack the understanding of stealthy for-purpose cyber-attacks. To advance the knowledge, this project will (1) develop new optimization, machine learning, and statistical tools to construct a GER control framework that is agnostic to GER type, scalable with respect to GER population and network dimension, and applicable for different grid services; (2) characterize privacy risks in GER management and develop cryptology-based and non-cryptology-based privacy-preserving decentralized optimization paradigms; (3) constitute cyber-attack vectors that leverage decentralized GER control algorithms for stealthy attack purposes, determine the detectability of those attacks, and develop corresponding detection and mitigation strategies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will develop a framework to better understand potential attacks and investigate several protection mechanisms. Broader comprehension and mitigation of these attacks hold crucial importance in protecting intellectual property and user privacy in mobile devices.

An adversary could exploit this leakage to build attacks and extract intellectual property, such as the hyper-parameters of neural networks used in biometric authentication, without requiring special privileges or comprised hardware. This project builds upon an attacker framework to extract unique memory-contention-based signatures of victim applications. New profiling and analysis techniques are developed to capture non-linear memory access characteristics of machine learning and artificial intelligence workloads. The signatures are then used to create reverse-engineering, information extraction and denial-of-service based attacks. Finally, various countermeasures at architecture- and system-level are developed against the new attacks.

Over half of Indiana Tech students are low-income and 47% identify as non-white. Over its six-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 21 unique full-time students who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in cybersecurity, information systems, network engineering, software engineering, computer engineering, and computer science. First-year students will receive up to four years of scholarship support. Scholars will benefit from a robust orientation process, participation in a common first-year experience course, monthly interaction with industry professionals, social events, robust faculty and peer mentoring programs, and experiential learning opportunities with a focus on career preparation. Additionally, mental health support will be available, and students will receive a laptop to ensure that they have adequate resources to complete their degree programs in computing-related fields. A robust evaluation plan will measure the impact of project activities on the participants. The broader impacts of the project include contributions to workforce diversity by adding at least 21 low-income computing professionals to the workforce.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. The specific aims of the project are to enroll three cohorts of seven low-income, domestic students who demonstrate academic achievement, talent, or promise and unmet need; achieve a first- to second- year retention rate of 85% and a six-year graduation rate of 75% for Developing Industry and Innovation Scholars in the Midwest (DIISM) scholars; prepare and place 100% of the DIISM graduates in the STEM workforce or a graduate program within six months of graduation; and measure the effectiveness of the programmatic elements in order to move toward institutionalization of the most promising supports. The six majors selected for this project are all fast-growing fields with a large number of career opportunities at salaries sufficient for upward social mobility. A focus on computing majors allows us to develop peer support and networking opportunities to increase engagement with the institution and program. The project team identified four critical needs that will be addressed by the project (1) inadequate preparation for college-level work (time-management, study skills, mathematics preparation, etc.); (2) technology issues, such as students trying to complete an entire course from a phone or iPad or having unreliable internet; (3) time commitments outside of their classes, such having to work at least 20 hours per week to afford college and, in some cases, working full time while also attending classes full time; and (4) an increase in mental health issues.

Complex systems are networks comprising many collaborating elements that continuously interact with each other in a nonlinear and counterintuitive manner; examples include cybersecurity, manufacturing processes, automated transportation infrastructure, medical devices, and many others relevant to our well-being. Faults in these systems are malfunctions, such as cyber-attack or sensor failure, that break security, degrade system functionality, and cause safety concerns and economic losses. Control of these systems is challenging because the dynamic behavior of the ensemble is intrinsically difficult to predict. This award supports fundamental research to build a ?fault-aware? control framework to study how interactions among individual elements produce the collective?s dynamics and how to alleviate the effect of faults on complex systems. To develop and test the control framework, a failing heart managed by a ventricular assist device will be used as the foundation to (i) detect device faults such as thrombosis and suction that jeopardize the survival of heart failure patients and (ii) automatically adjust the operation of the device under faults to improve the patient quality of life. The educational and outreach plan will focus on promoting active and life-long learning and engaging and training students at various levels, including veterans transitioning to civilian life, in emerging industries and transdisciplinary skills.<br/><br/>Using machine learning as the backbone, the objective of this research is to create a data-driven control strategy that regulates and maintains the system?s homeostasis following the onset of faults, while ensuring the system continues to operate in a seamless, continuous manner. This research will fill the knowledge gap for the supervision and control of complex systems when the governing phenomena are unknown and when first principle models are not readily attainable. The data-driven strategy will also overcome design limitations. Designing complex systems, such as ventricular assist devices, based on first principle models is costly, time consuming, and requires extensive expert knowledge to build application-specific models based on ubiquitous assumptions that are difficult to satisfy in practice. This research project will integrate data analytics, control theory, and machine learning into a unified framework with three innovative aspects: developing machine learning methods to discover symptomatic fingerprints of faults directly from data for real-time fault diagnosis; building an online adaptive modeling paradigm to predict performance-related variables that are not directly measurable due to economic considerations or technical constraints; designing a fault-tolerant controller to improve the system?s performance, while ensuring all operational constraints are met. In addition to its application to ventricular assist devices, this framework can be applied to protect computer systems from digital attacks, improve manufacturing efficiency, and address safety issues in automated transportation infrastructure and medical devices, leading to compelling societal and economic benefits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Enrichment often requires the use of complex compiled code, declarative queries, and/or expensive machine learning/signal processing modules. Traditionally, enrichment is performed as an offline process prior to making the data available for analysis. The recent trend towards real-time analytics has prompted industrial and research systems to explore enrichment during online data processing. These efforts have focused on optimizing enrichment at the time of data ingestion. This project will develop a new type of data management technology, to support real-time data analytics, entitled EnrichDB, that represents a significant departure from the above ingestion-based enrichment approaches. EnrichDB is based on the premise that enriching data in its entirety at ingestion can be (a) wasteful -- since applications may not require all data to be enriched; (b) result in unacceptable latencies -- if data arrival rates are high, or (c) not be feasible -- if enrichment functions are learned and incorporated into the system at a later time after ingestion. EnrichDB will explore seamlessly integrating data enrichment through the entire data processing pipeline - from ingestion to event-based intermittent enrichment, and progressively during query processing. EnrichDB will benefit real-time data analytics in multiple domains including IoT-enabled smart spaces, text and social media analytics, cybersecurity, network surveillance, etc.  <br/><br/>EnrichDB will address a variety of challenges that arise in enabling enrichment through different stages of the data processing pipeline. One such challenge is to explicitly represent the state of enrichment of the objects  (i.e., which enrichment functions have been applied to which objects); such a state will drive additional enrichments required downstream in data processing. Another challenge is to develop mechanisms to support enrichment during query processing efficiently since query-time enrichment could result in unacceptable latencies. Techniques need to be designed to enrich data progressively while processing queries to provide answers at acceptable levels of quality and latency. Such progressive processing logic could either be layered on top of existing databases or could be incorporated natively into database engines by rethinking storage, indexing, and query processing to support enrichment. The project will explore challenges that arise for both these cases. Finally, self-driving strategies to decide which objects should be enriched to what degree at what stage of the data processing pipelines need to be designed. Such an approach would complement a strategy wherein such decisions are made by the system administrator. EnrichDB will be used in advanced data management classes and will be integrated into a campus-level smart space testbed at UCI entitled TIPPERS that supports a variety of  services including real-time occupancy counts and other building usage analysis, at the UCI campus.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditional NICs are simple devices attached to a server, used to receive packets from the network and place them in the server's memory. Packets then wait for processing time by the general-purpose processor, or CPU, at the server. Recently, a new generation of NICs, known as SmartNICs, has emerged. SmartNICs allow programmers to offload certain tasks, such as network and security tasks, from the server's CPU to the SmartNIC. They also enable programmers to write customized applications running on the SmartNIC?s domain-specific processors at speeds that may be orders of magnitude faster than those running on the server's CPUs. These capabilities improve data processing performance, enhance security, and reduce the processing load on the server's CPUs. While large cloud providers are now using SmartNICs, campus networks and small- and medium-sized enterprises have yet to fully benefit from their advantages. An important barrier preventing the adoption of SmartNICs is the lack of engaging training materials for cyberinfrastructure contributors and professionals. This project aims to bridge that gap by developing hands-on virtual labs for instruction that are hosted on web-based platforms for easy and broad access. By providing accessible and practical training, the project will lower the barrier to innovation and promote progress on areas such as scientific applications requiring massive data transfers, machine learning relying on high processing speeds, and cybersecurity applications requiring massive traffic inspection.<br/><br/>The project has two overarching goals. The first project goal, contributing to the project?s intellectual merit, is to advance the state of the art in SmartNIC training within the research community in order to promote and facilitate the broader adoption of SmartNICs among cyberinfrastructure professionals, contributors, and network owners. The project will develop training material in the form of virtual labs and companion material, including guided experiments and interactive electronic booklets, on technologies related to SmartNICs. The virtual labs will be used for workshops and self-paced training. These labs will enable cyberinfrastructure contributors (including developers and researchers) to learn how to implement offloaded applications on various SmartNICs. The virtual labs will also permit cyberinfrastructure professionals (including system administrators, research support staff, and facilitators) to learn how to deploy those applications, how to manage SmartNICs, and how to provide effective support. The virtual labs will be deployed on the NSF-funded FABRIC platform (NSF award #1935966) and on the Academic Cloud at the University of South Carolina, which will serve as training platforms. The virtual labs will cover open-source technologies that are compatible with commercial SmartNICs. The second project goal, contributing to its broader impact, is to incorporate virtual labs into educational curricula and instructional resources. The project will target associate, bachelor, and graduate programs. Two-year community colleges will use the virtual labs to train students on SmartNICs administration and operation, including the deployment of pre-developed applications. Four-year bachelor and graduate-level programs will use the virtual labs to provide in-depth training on SmartNIC programming, starting from the foundational principles to the development of advanced applications that accelerate data processing and analytics. Training activities for the two project goals include organizing workshops with cyberinfrastructure communities, including national and regional Research and Education Networks; professional development events with the NSF-funded Minority-Serving Cyberinfrastructure Consortium, a collaborative consortium that provides professional development and training opportunities to minority serving institutions; and train-the-trainer tutorials with centers supporting college instructors and students.  Best practices and technical specifications produced by this project are incorporated into NSF's ACCESS Knowledge Base, to disseminate them to the broader community of researchers.<br/><br/>This award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Division of Computer and Network Systems within the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The decentralized nature of MAL systems and agents' exploration behavior, however, introduce new vulnerabilities unseen in standalone machine learning systems and traditional distributed systems. This project aims to develop a data-driven approach to MAL security that can provide an adequate level of protection even in the presence of persistent, coordinated, and stealthy malicious insiders or external adversaries. The main novelty of the project is to go beyond heuristics-based attack and defense schemes by incorporating opponent modeling and adaptation into security-related decision-making in a principled way. The project contributes to the emerging fields of science of security and trustworthy artificial intelligence via a cross-disciplinary approach that integrates cybersecurity, multi-agent systems, machine learning, and cognitive science. The interdisciplinary nature of this project also brings unique opportunities for both curriculum development and student training.<br/><br/>Developing robust defenses for large-scale MAL systems faces fundamental challenges induced by the hidden behavioral patterns of malicious agents, the dynamics and uncertainty of the environment, and the necessity of protecting benign agents' local data in many privacy-sensitive settings. This project tackles the challenges by incrementally developing a (machine) theory of mind for adversarial decision-making in three research thrusts. The first thrust develops learning-based targeted and untargeted attacks against federated and decentralized machine learning systems. These attacks first infer a world model from publicly available data and then apply model-based reinforcement learning to identify an adaptive attack policy that can fully exploit the vulnerabilities of the systems. The second thrust investigates a proactive defense framework that combines adversarial training and local adaptation, utilizing the automated attack framework developed in the first thrust as a simulator of adversaries to obtain robust defenses. The third thrust studies security in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning systems by addressing a set of new challenges, including complicated interactions among agents, non-stationarity, and partial observability. The goal is to understand how malicious attacks and deceptions can prevent benign agents from reaching a socially preferred outcome and how accounting for a higher order of beliefs can help an agent (benign or malicious) in both fully cooperative and mixed-motive settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

General-purpose graph algorithms and graph-based machine learning methods have had some success when applied to a number of security problems ranging from detecting malicious websites and compromised devices in computer networks to detecting compromised or inauthentic accounts in social networks.  However, because the existing methods are designed for generic contexts rather than for specific security problems, there is room to improve their performance in detecting bad actors in networks.  Further, in security contexts, there is often a determined adversary trying to evade detection that general-purpose algorithms are not designed to consider, which makes them vulnerable to attack.  This project will develop novel graph inference algorithms that consider unique characteristics of security problems, analyze the spectrum of possible attacks on such algorithms, define measures of their robustness against attack, and develop methods to improve their robustness.  The project team will create and share datasets related to graph-based security analytics along with software that implements their algorithms and robustness measures with both industrial practitioners and other researchers.  They will also mentor undergraduate and graduate students in the research, using the problems and data to support new college courses and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) outreach activities for K-12 students.<br/><br/>The work focuses on collective classification algorithms that simultaneously label all nodes in a network as malicious or benign.  The first main research thrust involves advancing analytic techniques that combine random walk and loopy belief propagation-based algorithms through local rules that model the joint probabilities of a given node and its neighbors being malicious.  To do this, the team will develop versions of the algorithms that relax assumptions that neighboring nodes have strong homophily, developing characterizations of neighboring nodes' relationships and creating novel Markov Random Field formulations that leverage these characterizations.  The second research thrust will model the attack surface of collective classification algorithms, characterizing the goals and capabilities of attackers, the cost of evasive moves such as creating nodes or edges and generating network activity, and the effect of different goals, capabilities, and levels of evasion on the algorithms' performance.  The third thrust will be to develop methods to identify such evasion by developing attacker-resistant link prediction algorithms and similarity metrics, then mitigate evasion efforts through developing local rule-based techniques that add noise to graphs in ways that confound attacks.  The team will evaluate the metrics and algorithms on datasets from a number of domains, including malicious users in social networks, malicious URLs in the web graph, malicious domains embedded in domain name service redirects, and malicious orders in an e-commerce marketplace.  These problems, and the associated datasets, will be integrated into an existing course on data-driven security and a new graduate seminar course on collective classification.

The research will develop a framework to better understand potential attacks and investigate several protection mechanisms. Broader comprehension and mitigation of these attacks hold crucial importance in protecting intellectual property and user privacy in mobile devices. The award contributes to enabling a more secure operation of billions of mobile devices used daily around the globe. <br/><br/>This project investigates a critical side-channel leakage mechanism based on the memory-access contention occurring when multiple applications execute together in a multi-processor system with shared memory.

This project builds upon an attacker framework to extract unique memory-contention-based signatures of victim applications. New profiling and analysis techniques are developed to capture non-linear memory access characteristics of machine learning and artificial intelligence workloads. The signatures are then used to create reverse-engineering, information extraction and denial-of-service based attacks. Finally, various countermeasures at architecture- and system-level are developed against the new attacks. The research team investigates the security, performance, area, and energy implications of new memory controller scheduling policies and randomization-based solutions.

Digitization and connectivity are the cornerstones of modern manufacturing, but these very qualities allow cyberphysical attacks to negatively impact part performance by stealthily altering the digital representations of geometry, process plans, and/or in-situ sensing signals. This has the potential to pose a significant threat to societal well-being, economic stability, and national security by introducing defective parts into electronics, spacecraft, planes, automobiles, biomedical devices, and energy components. The state-of-the-art practice of dealing with such attacks by sacrificing productivity, yield, cost, and connectivity to ensure part performance critically limits pervasive and trustworthy adoption of Industry 4.0 and digital manufacturing. This research project will create and validate a novel computational paradigm called Smart-Recover that actively assures every part?s performance despite cyberphysical attacks and with minimal loss in productivity, yield, connectivity, or cost-effectiveness. The research will be complemented by developing a multi-institutional manufacturing cybersecurity education program for workforce development across high school, undergraduate, and graduate educational levels.<br/><br/>The specific goal of the research is to establish the mathematical basis for the Smart-Recover paradigm, which combines pre-fabrication correction of attack-altered geometric models with stoppage-free in-process mitigation of defects created by attack-modified process plans and attack-distorted in-situ sensing signals. To this end, the research objectives include the creation of techniques for: (1) pre-fabrication computational reconstruction of only the attack-altered features of the digital geometric model; (2) in-process remodification of process plans to disrupt formation of local defects induced by atypical attack-driven alteration of exogenous process parameters; and (3) in-process restoration of defect prediction accuracy for attack-altered sensor signals at speeds necessary for local defect mitigation. The research team will further explore the generalizability and collective interaction of these elements of Smart-Recover with stealthy and system-spanning cyberphysical attacks via two manufacturing testbeds. These advances will be achieved via innovations at the convergence of geometric design, machine learning, in-situ sensing, and physics-based modeling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Originally funded under NSF 14-605 and NSF 15-598, NHERI has operated since 2015 through separate, but coordinated, five-year research infrastructure awards for a Network Coordination Office, CI, Computational Modeling and Simulation Center, and Experimental Facilities, including a post-disaster, rapid response research facility.  Information about NHERI resources are available at the NHERI web portal (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org). Awards made for NHERI contribute to NSF's role in the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) and the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP). This award will renew the NHERI Experimental Facility at the University of California-Davis from January 1, 2021, to September 30, 2025. Through this award, the University of California-Davis will provide access to their experimental resources, user services, and data management infrastructure for NSF-supported research and education awards. This facility will provide users with access to geotechnical modeling resources that include 9-meter and 1-meter radius centrifuges, both with shake tables. Centrifuges enable the use of reduced-scale models to accurately capture the responses of soil masses that are many times larger than is possible at full scale on even the largest shake tables. The 9-meter centrifuge has the largest radius of any centrifuge with a shake table worldwide, and can carry a soil payload of 1550 kilograms. Performing experiments on detailed, reduced-scale models, outfitted with large numbers of sensors, will enable major scientific and engineering advances for a broad range of soil and soil-structure systems, such as building foundations, bridge foundations, near-shore and off-shore energy infrastructure foundations, underground structures, pipelines, ground improvement technologies, wharves, embankment dams, and levee systems. Research can be performed that will enable major advances in the ability of engineers to predict and improve the performance of soil and soil-structure systems affected by earthquake, wave, wind, and storm surge loadings. Research performed by the facility's broad base of users will contribute to the economic competitiveness of the United States, better infrastructure management, and improved well-being of citizens through, for example, modified building codes, new seismic design criteria, and partnering projects for major infrastructure systems.  Experimental data generated from research conducted at this facility will be archived in the Data Depot on the NHERI web portal. <br/><br/>Together, the 9-meter and 1-meter radius geotechnical centrifuges will provide the unique and versatile modeling capabilities required for realizing major scientific and engineering advances in predicting and improving the performance of soil and soil-structure systems affected by natural hazard loadings. Available resources at the centrifuge facility will provide the capability to construct soil and soil-structure models with holistic system levels of complexity and obtain measurements of complex local mechanisms through inverse analyses of data from dense instrumentation arrays. The centrifuge facility will enable the formation of basic science knowledge; the validation of advanced computational models from the component to holistic system level; the validation of transformative mitigation strategies; and the integration of research, education, and outreach activities in the training of a diverse workforce. The facility will conduct annual user workshops and will host Research Experiences for Undergraduate students. The facility's user support will: (1) help users improve their experimental investigations through personalized guidance and support at the proposal, design, construction, testing, and interpretation phases of their research; (2) maintain a parallel and uninterrupted workflow that maximizes scheduling flexibility; (3) maintain, improve, and develop technical resources for the facility; (4) integrate safety and risk awareness into routine operational practices; (5) provide cybersecurity and data management; (6) provide mentoring and technical training for research team members; (7) promote research opportunities to key interest groups to broaden and diversify the user base; (8) manage maintenance cycles to avoid impacting user schedules; and (9) engage in key outreach activities with the national and international hazards research communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditional NICs are simple devices attached to a server, used to receive packets from the network and place them in the server's memory. Packets then wait for processing time by the general-purpose processor, or CPU, at the server. Recently, a new generation of NICs, known as SmartNICs, has emerged. SmartNICs allow programmers to offload certain tasks, such as network and security tasks, from the server's CPU to the SmartNIC. They also enable programmers to write customized applications running on the SmartNIC?s domain-specific processors at speeds that may be orders of magnitude faster than those running on the server's CPUs. These capabilities improve data processing performance, enhance security, and reduce the processing load on the server's CPUs. While large cloud providers are now using SmartNICs, campus networks and small- and medium-sized enterprises have yet to fully benefit from their advantages. An important barrier preventing the adoption of SmartNICs is the lack of engaging training materials for cyberinfrastructure contributors and professionals. This project aims to bridge that gap by developing hands-on virtual labs for instruction that are hosted on web-based platforms for easy and broad access. By providing accessible and practical training, the project will lower the barrier to innovation and promote progress on areas such as scientific applications requiring massive data transfers, machine learning relying on high processing speeds, and cybersecurity applications requiring massive traffic inspection.<br/><br/>The project has two overarching goals. The first project goal, contributing to the project?s intellectual merit, is to advance the state of the art in SmartNIC training within the research community in order to promote and facilitate the broader adoption of SmartNICs among cyberinfrastructure professionals, contributors, and network owners. The project will develop training material in the form of virtual labs and companion material, including guided experiments and interactive electronic booklets, on technologies related to SmartNICs. The virtual labs will be used for workshops and self-paced training. These labs will enable cyberinfrastructure contributors (including developers and researchers) to learn how to implement offloaded applications on various SmartNICs. The virtual labs will also permit cyberinfrastructure professionals (including system administrators, research support staff, and facilitators) to learn how to deploy those applications, how to manage SmartNICs, and how to provide effective support. The virtual labs will be deployed on the NSF-funded FABRIC platform (NSF award #1935966) and on the Academic Cloud at the University of South Carolina, which will serve as training platforms. The virtual labs will cover open-source technologies that are compatible with commercial SmartNICs. The second project goal, contributing to its broader impact, is to incorporate virtual labs into educational curricula and instructional resources. The project will target associate, bachelor, and graduate programs. Two-year community colleges will use the virtual labs to train students on SmartNICs administration and operation, including the deployment of pre-developed applications. Four-year bachelor and graduate-level programs will use the virtual labs to provide in-depth training on SmartNIC programming, starting from the foundational principles to the development of advanced applications that accelerate data processing and analytics. Training activities for the two project goals include organizing workshops with cyberinfrastructure communities, including national and regional Research and Education Networks; professional development events with the NSF-funded Minority-Serving Cyberinfrastructure Consortium, a collaborative consortium that provides professional development and training opportunities to minority serving institutions; and train-the-trainer tutorials with centers supporting college instructors and students.  Best practices and technical specifications produced by this project are incorporated into NSF's ACCESS Knowledge Base, to disseminate them to the broader community of researchers.<br/><br/>This award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Division of Computer and Network Systems within the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Direct connectivity allows for the exploration of how satellites and constellations might interconnect without revealing proprietary information of each constellation, creating the equivalent of interdomain routing for space networks. Additional capabilities examine behavior in the face of disruptions such as large solar storms. Achieving these new capabilities requires merging lab-based spacecraft hardware with a large-scale state-of-the-art wireless radio testbed to create more flexible and higher fidelity rendering of the satellite links, resulting in a networked HIL development and a testing environment that accurately models the network and dynamics; routing and re-routing data link tables on the fly, scaled to multiply-redundant algorithms and architectures; satellite-like lab hardware for testbed nodes; and virtual nodes and remote access for government, industry, and academic researchers.<br/> <br/>The expected outcome is a remotely-accessible, multi-domain network and cybersecurity research infrastructure, and a validated first-of-its-kind adaptive and assured space network communications emulator.

Despite the decade-long research efforts on DP, there still exists a critical research problem that has been largely overlooked, that is all existing DP studies are grounded on the hypothesis that software can easily and faithfully sample and add noises from a probability distribution. However, this hypothesis is being constantly challenged by recent findings about its privacy violation and by the growing demand of privacy protection in low-end devices that may lack high-level software libraries. Hence, this project's innovative research angle is to realize DP mechanisms directly on embedded memories, which are ubiquitous in modern electronic devices. On the technical front, the developed innovation has the following merits. (1) It frees host devices from dedicated software and accomplishes the vision of ""privacy by design""; (2) It concurrently improves manifold system performance such as power efficiency, privacy, and chip overhead; (3) The developed technique is primitive, generic, and scalable to every electronic device.<br/><br/>This project will also create profound impact on our society, economy, and workforce development. Specifically, the developed technique will be transformative to numerous sensitive applications (e.g., surveillance and sensing) and critical infrastructures (e.g., Internet of Things devices). It will potentially increase the U.S. chip vendors' revenue and competitiveness by adding privacy-preserving functionality to their chips, protect taxpayers' and enterprises' sensitive data, safeguard national security, and help the U.S. out-compete global competitors in cybersecurity.

The total amount of data created, and used globally in the year 2022 was estimated to be 97 zettabytes and projected to grow to 181 zettabytes by the year 2025. The extremely large data size poses enormous challenges to data operations and in particular to NAND flash memory deletion. Due to the unique architecture of NAND array, current NAND flash storage systems cannot utilize the standard overwrite-based erasure techniques but instead use a resource-light deletion operation, such as all-zero scrubbing, which could become vulnerable for data leakage. The deleted data can still be partially recovered by carefully analyzing the analog reading of the memory bits. Addressing the vulnerability of flash memory deletion requires a deeper understanding on how an adversary could exploit the analog reading of a flash memory to reconstruct the original deleted information.  To achieve this goal, this research studies on how an adversary can use machine learning techniques to recover deleted information from flash storage. The project?s novelties are to apply machine learning techniques to validate the efficacy of reconstructing original data from scrubbed flash memory and to evaluate the susceptibility of various data types to adversary attacks. The project's broader significance and importance are: The research findings will led to more trusted data cleaning methods deemed secure and irrecoverable after scrubbing. The flash memory manufacturers can directly benefit from such findings and secure their memory scrubbing processes. A direct outcome of this project will be the training of two graduate students with research experiences in cybersecurity and machine learning.<br/><br/>By applying analog reading techniques to classify deleted bits as strong or weak zeros, it was shown that a deleted image in flash memory can be restored to a recognizable level. An adversary can easily use machine learning techniques to reconstruct deleted information from flash memory. The feasibility of reconstruction is greatly influenced by the detection thresholds and types of data used, as they exhibit varying degrees and types of continuity that may determine the success of ML models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Adopting privacy-preserving solutions to practice in such applications is often hindered by the loss in utility and lack of scalability to large-scale problems with billions of nodes/edges. This project aims to develop private algorithms for several fundamental problems in graph mining and network science, that can scale to networks of the size that arise in real-world applications and provide good accuracy bounds. The project?s broader significance and importance are that private algorithms will become available to a new community of researchers from public-health policy planning, cybersecurity and social network analysis. <br/> <br/>Adopting graph differential privacy (DP) as the notion of privacy, this project achieves the above goals through fundamental contributions in privacy-preserving algorithm design for various fundamental problems in graph mining and network science, such as subgraph detection, node ranking, community detection, and studying properties of graph dynamical systems such as epidemic spread on networks. The project leverages tools from distributed computation, such as sampling and sketching, and develops innovative tools for graph DP to yield highly-scalable private graph algorithms with rigorous accuracy bounds (both in theory and practice). Finally, the project will lead to the development of a private graph processing system, which will be incorporated into a network science cyber-infrastructure. Accordingly, the tools of graph DP will be made available to the broader community of network science and computational epidemiology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, this project aims to achieve the research goal by developing a series of interpretation algorithms and methods from the following aspects. It explores post-hoc interpretation methods to shed light on how deep learning models produce a specific prediction and generate a representation. It also investigates designing interpretable models from scratch, which aims to construct self-explanatory models and incorporate interpretability directly into the structure of a deep learning model. The aforementioned interpretation derived from a deep learning model is employed to promote the model performance.

Traditional access control methods have been inadequate in preventing improper data flow, especially as systems become increasingly complex. This project seeks to make fine-grained IFC practical and widely deployable in today?s computing environments. The research promises to significantly improve the way software systems manage confidentiality and integrity, ultimately resulting in a much more secure cyberspace. The resulting IFC systems will be available as open source tools. Users of Rust will have the benefits of sound IFC analysis. The results will be folded into course and curriculum to enhance cybersecurity education. <br/><br/>Specifically, the research focuses on the Rust programming language, leveraging its unique features to build a novel IFC system. First, a new static IFC library, tailored to Rust, will be designed to minimize programming model restrictions while effectively controlling side effects -- an elusive goal in mainstream languages.

Importance of anomaly detection lies in the fact that an anomaly in the observed data may be a sign of an unwanted and often actionable event such as failure, malicious activity, etc. in the underlying system. In many real-time systems, timely and accurate detection of abnormal data patterns is crucial, and will allow proper countermeasures to be taken in a timely manner, to counteract any possible harm. Although anomaly detection has long been studied, today's complex networks exhibit new challenges, such as: low latency requirements, data size, system dynamics, unknown distributions, distributed nature, and privacy. The objective of this proposal is to investigate effective and scalable approaches for real-time data-driven anomaly detection in complex systems with these challenges. The main themes of this proposal address multiple important problems in the early detection of anomalies and attacks in a general complex network setting. Considering the importance of cybersecurity in today's world, methodologies to understand and forewarn changes in the organizational dynamics of such complicated networks is of immense significance. This proposal directly addresses these issues by bringing a fresh and novel set of engineering tools and ideas.<br/><br/>Following a systematic approach, this project first considers (1) how to timely detect anomalies in centralized high-dimensional systems with dynamicity and hidden anomaly challenges; (ii) how to deal with resource constraints in monitoring distributed systems; and (iii) how to enable privacy-preserving solutions for real-time anomaly detection in distributed systems. These challenges and the solution methods presented in this project are generally applicable to a variety of complex systems. To be specific, this project focuses on two challenging IoT networks: surveillance camera network and smart home network. The proposed approaches exploit an array of advanced techniques including sequential change detection, deep reinforcement learning, event-triggered processing, and differential privacy, and will bring significant innovations to the theory and applications of anomaly detection. In particular, the practical use of proposed algorithms will be demonstrated and their performance will be evaluated with respect to the state of the art using hardware implementations of two IoT networks - a surveillance camera network and a smart home network.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Driving is an essential part of our daily lives and is vulnerable to a range of distractions that can compromise safety on the road. While internal and external sensing data can be collected and used to improve driving safety, modeling, analyzing, and predicting driver behaviors and attention are challenging due to their dynamic nature and complexity.  The data collection and processing also raise concerns about drivers? privacy, which is under-investigated in the field and can lead to various cybersecurity vulnerabilities. This project aims to develop a new way to examine and interpret driver behavior and attention to exploit the potential of deep learning-based sensing, reasoning, control, and actuation in a dynamic traffic and driving environment while preserving drivers' privacy. The research can potentially uncover new AI knowledge-based theories and result in a synergistic integration of these new theories with deep learning, prediction, and control. The results from this project will help enable active safety, promote privacy-preserving autonomous driving, and contribute to the development of smart education and national defense. This project will offer research opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students and provide outreach activities to middle school students to foster the growth of the future science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce with engineering and AI skills. <br/><br/>This project seeks to develop a data-driven, deep learning-based conceptual framework with knowledge representation and inference rules for capturing, analyzing, and modeling driver behaviors and cognition in real-world driving scenarios. First, driving behaviors and inner connections among behavior, attention, and action will be investigated by exploring limited sensory data while considering privacy protection. The impacts of human and road environment factors on driving distraction will be assessed. Then, an explainable neural network will be developed to model the driver?s behavior, driving preferences, and distinctive features with knowledge representation and inference rules to predict the driver?s attention and intention. Finally, deep learning techniques will be created to predict the angle and direction of the wheel steering based on actual driver models and perceptions of the surrounding environment.  With successful execution, this project is expected to result in a prototype sensing-intelligence-control-actuation closed-loop system with the proposed theories, models, networks, and techniques.

Although there are promising legitimate applications of these techniques, they also raise serious trust and security threats. Cybercriminals increasingly weaponize AI synthesis techniques to deceive users and manipulate opinions without having to invest heavily in manual content generation. For instance, AI-synthesized profile photographs are abused to create fake accounts, while deepfake videos that simulate real people can give cybercriminals the ability to defame or impersonate others. Existing detection work mostly relies on ""black-box"" approaches that analyze content without considering the way the AI synthesis techniques work. This project's goal is to use ""white-box"" methods that consider how the techniques work, both to systematically detect AI-synthesized content, and to outline general principles that underlie how broad classes of AI synthesis algorithms work that will help detection algorithms adapt as new synthesis techniques are developed. The results of this research will reinforce user trust in online content and help social media sites and other Internet platforms mitigate deception through AI-synthesized content. The project team will integrate the new datasets and techniques developed in this research into undergraduate and graduate courses as well as online exercises to train future cybersecurity workers. The team will also support diverse participation in the research, actively recruiting and mentoring women and people from other under-represented groups.<br/><br/>This research aims to advance AI synthesis detection in terms of efficacy, generalizability, and robustness. The work focuses on detecting AI-synthesized images and videos, as humans are more likely to be attracted to and deceived by visual content. The developed analytics principles are envisioned to inspire new work in these areas and expand to detection of other types of AI-synthesized content. The project is organized around three research thrusts. First, the team will develop a unified analytic framework to systematically dissect AI-synthesis models and gain deep understanding of synthesis patterns common across the models. Second, based on these findings, the team will design generalizable approaches based on the frequency and pixel domains to efficiently detect AI-synthesized images and videos and operate at scale. Third, it will enhance detection robustness by proactively investigating adversarial evasion strategies and prioritizing detection techniques resistant to those strategies. The framework and the developed techniques will be thoroughly evaluated with large-scale real-world data.

Quantum Computing can potentially accelerate these to just a few minutes or even seconds thanks to the strange properties of quantum mechanics. However, Quantum Computing is still in its infancy, and facing hurdles such as the very low number of quantum bits (or qubits) and the high levels of noise. This project proposes the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to extract useful information out of the noisy outputs of quantum computers.  By extracting the key features of the noise that disturbs the output, ML algorithms can separate the useful information from the noise. This has two advantages that will be the goals of this project. On one hand, it will enable the use quantum computers despite their noisy nature. On the other, it will allow for the simplification of the quantum applications through approximations, requiring less hardware resources and computational steps. In this way, the project tackles the two problems mentioned above -low number of qubits and high noise levels- to make quantum computing acceleration a reality. <br/><br/>Quantum computing holds great potential as an accelerator of computational problems with significant societal impact. Some of these problems are in the fields of healthcare and drug development, finances or cybersecurity to mention a few. Although great progress has been made in recent years to reach practical quantum computation, its true potential cannot be achieved under its current limited number of qubits and high error rates.  This work will apply Machine Learning and Statistical Signal Processing concepts to enhance the robustness of quantum computing applications. Robust quantum systems will enable the application of approximate computing approaches to simplify the hardware and software demands of quantum circuits design, pre-processing and simulation.  Quantum circuits rely on multiple runs (shots) to find the solution in the final measured state, and produce their outcome in the form of a probability distribution. This unique feature of quantum computers can be turned into a strength. This research is driven by the following research hypothesis: that although approximate quantum computing will alter the measured probability distribution, it will not compromise its correctness if the changes are well understood and applied. The team will explore approximate circuits and software-level approximation to answer the following questions: (i) to what extent alterations to the probability distribution of the measured outcome can be tolerated, and still reach the right outcome in quantum processing; (ii) to what extent quantum approximate computing is able to reduce the quantum hardware requirements and classical pre-processing demands; (iii) in which way approximation techniques affect the probability distribution of the outcome. Therefore, the project has two objectives: The first objective is to enhance the robustness of quantum systems by applying Machine Learning to identify the correct solutions in the system?s outcome. Taking advantage of the enhanced robustness, the second objective is to identify quantum computations that can be approximated, making more efficient use of hardware resources, while still resulting in correct solutions. The final goal of this research it to contribute to the building of robust and hardware efficient quantum acceleration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will develop a local, on-chip hardware security mechanism to enhance security at the root but with lower power and cost overhead.  The proposed techniques are transformative and has the potential to harden security in ultra-low power applications.  Research outcomes from this project will be disseminated as tutorials at leading hardware security and circuit conferences to raise awareness about security vulnerabilities in low-power sensing devices.

New educational materials for the general public on the security applications of circuit design considerations and possible tradeoffs for security, area, and power will also be developed. Engagements of undergraduate students in research through the research experience for undergraduates (REU) program and annual summer projects are planned for visiting students from minority serving institutions, and high schools. <br/><br/>This research aims to develop ultra-low power, on-chip, hardware security solutions for IoT sensing devices. Low-power sensing devices duty-cycle their communication and sensing activity and as such spend the large fraction of their time sleeping to conserve and harvest energy. Denial-of-sleep attacks target this feature to deny them of much-needed sleep by initiating frequent wake up and repeated communication requests to quickly drain their stored energy. The goal of this project is to explore new methods of defense against denial-of-sleep attacks by analyzing the energy consumption patterns of a sensing device. Their activity and energy consumption patterns can be extracted as features and learned to differentiate a denial-of-sleep attack from a regular activity of the device. This project will develop an on-chip learning method to prevent denial-of-sleep attacks. An energy monitoring system will be developed to continuously track the availability and consumption of the energy in a sensing device. The monitoring system will tap into key circuit points of the power management system to realize a lower cost hardware solution. Further, the architecture of a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) circuit will be advanced to operate at ultra-low power level with a lower area overhead. This circuit will reside outside of the radio front-end and will continuously monitor the RF channel for jamming attacks.

Recently, natural language generation systems (NLGs) are becoming popular. Examples include question and answer systems and chatbots that are used for advancing public health, and social sensing systems that are used for emergency response and crime prevention. However, there are risks that attackers may be able to manipulate these systems leading to poor outputs and poor decision-making. Robustness to adversaries in deep learning systems has become an active topic in the machine learning and security communities, but the robustness of NLG-based systems is much less studied. This is important to address because there are many differences in the nature of the data and algorithms deep learning and NLG systems employ, as well as the types of tasks they are used for. This project will address these differences through a comprehensive look at the kinds of attacks natural language generation systems are vulnerable to, developing both mathematical models of their vulnerabilities and strategies for reducing them through changes in how NLG systems are designed. This, in turn, will lead to safer, more trustworthy NLG systems and provide a number of educational opportunities for students involved in the research and related classes.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the project is to understand NLG systems' attack surface and vulnerabilities and develop novel empirical and theoretical methods for increasing their adversarial robustness. The work will be grounded in two common NLG tasks, summarization and question-answering, and structured around three interconnected aims. The first is developing a framework and proposing novel AI-based optimization methods for examining NLG systems against various attack models. The second is having an in-depth analysis and characterization of vulnerabilities that lead to such attacks. The third is developing a set of defensive methods and tools for enhancing the robustness of NLG systems.

Swarthmore College will employ the solution in collaborative linguistics and social interactions research.<br/><br/>In addition to these immediate applications, the proposed PA Science DMZ opens the door to a multitude of additional research opportunities, both within the initial consortium and through collaborations with smaller institutions that are currently unable to access critical tools of contemporary science. By implementing a regional model for aggregating cyberinfrastructure hardware and human resources, the project aims to provide a robust and economically efficient template for additional initiatives within the state and nationwide, fostering a more inclusive and interconnected cyberinfrastructure landscape.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They often operate on sensitive data in safety-critical environments, such as transportation, health care, and industrial control. An important aspect of securing embedded electronic systems is to prevent information leakage at the level of system behavior. There exist multiple venues by which an attacker can get such information even without having complete access to the internal system components. Specifically, electromagnetic (EM) fields emanated during software activity in electronic systems contain important information about the underlying system behavior. This project will develop tools that system designers can use to ensure resilience against information being leaked through EM side channels. As part of outreach and education components, this project will develop a short course on physical and IoT security that will use interdisciplinary cybersecurity challenges spanning cryptography, electromagnetics, embedded system, and hardware/software design topics to generate interest in pursuing careers in science and technology.<br/><br/>The only existing capability for EM side-channel analysis is based on cumbersome laboratory measurements. This is a fundamental problem, as most embedded software developers are not in a position to carry out lab-based characterization of EM vulnerabilities. Such characterizations require instrumentation expertise that a typical software engineer lacks, are expensive, provide limited observability, and are slow compared to what a computational tool flow enables. This project will develop novel simulation-based approaches for characterization of EM fields emanated by software running on complex embedded processors. This will require fast yet accurate tracking of spatio-temporal EM emanations all the way from circuits to processor micro-architectures to software running on them. The simulation tool flow to be developed will permit design of improved system-level defenses against malware as well as minimization of side-channel leakage through embedded HW/SW co-design at both compiler and micro-architecture levels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nonetheless, sensor reliability and data integrity play a crucial role in these vehicles. As vehicles and infrastructures grow increasingly networked and automated, there is a pressing need to identify sensor-related anomalies and mitigate potential safety hazards they might pose. The overarching goal of this project is to protect the connected vehicular network against anomalous sensor readings from any cause to ensure the safety of vehicles and passengers.

Since the closure of the dominant adult ad website, Backpage, many competing sites have emerged. Also, the prevalence of anonymous electronic payment methods has led to a significant increase in scam ads, which adds noise for identifying trafficked individuals. The fragmented marketplace, large volume of ad postings, and presence of scam ads have made monitoring efforts quite chaotic. Moreover, little is known about links between new adult ad sites, how they operate, and how the patterns that emerge in adult ad data correlate with other illicit activities. This project will determine methods to filter signal and noise in the ad data to inform law enforcement organizations (LEOs) and policy-makers operating in this new environment. Developing a deep understanding of how the sites work with the potential to uncover links to higher-level organized crime will provide a new foundation upon which researchers in diverse areas including operations research, cybersecurity, and the social sciences can use to study and disrupt human trafficking in the digital age.<br/><br/>Using more than 100 million adult ads posted since 2020 from 14 sites, this research project has four research objectives: (1) understand the posting processes, monetization schemes, and the protection and defense mechanisms employed by prominent sites in the current online adult ad ecosystem; (2) develop multidisciplinary approaches for estimating ad legitimacy; (3) investigate techniques that legitimate posters use to evade law enforcement interdiction; and (4) Understand how multiplex network analysis (i.e., drugs, transportation) can contribute to improved accuracy for identifying potential trafficking activity. We collaborate with a regional human trafficking task force, which is composed of officers from several LEOs, and a non-profit organization that works to identify potential trafficking victims and connect them with resources to get out of ?the life.? A diverse group of researchers, practitioners, and students will participate in this project. The research team will take deliberate efforts to recruit students from underrepresented groups for this project. Developed methods will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate course materials for IS, OR, and Analytics programs.

Strengthening the cyber security of national infrastructures such as the power grid is of major concern. This has led to a significant research literature on power systems cybersecurity. Most of this literature focuses on cyberattack prevention and less on dealing with attacks aimed at bypassing the detection stage. Hence, this research will study reaction mechanisms to remediate incidents on power systems that are caused by cyberattacks bypassing the detection stage. The developed remedial action frameworks in this project will yield new insights that will be valuable to researchers/engineers working on resilience improvement for smart distribution systems against non-detectable cyberattacks. The outcomes of this research will be shared with professional engineers (PEs) via industry seminars, providing professional development hours and updating their knowledge on vulnerability of power systems to cyberattacks. In addition, the project will broaden participation in engineering through summer workshops to involve K-12 students from underrepresented groups for the purpose of diversifying the STEM leaders for modern operation of the U.S power grid.<br/><br/>The focus of this project is to address the following research issue: ?How to react to cyberattacks on the load tap changing (LTC) mechanism of autotransformers within power distribution systems to tackle an intended voltage collapse.? Within this scope, the first objective of the research is to investigate vulnerability of LTCs to cyberattacks targeting voltage collapse in distribution systems. Reaching this objective for a distribution system operator will result in a sophisticated attack model that bypasses state estimation-based bad data detection, based on which realistic remedial actions can be developed. The second objective is to design primary/backup reaction mechanisms to mitigate the voltage collapse resulting from the attacked LTCs. To attain this objective, several algorithms will be created to design a primary remediation technique based on distribution network reconfiguration customized by a deep learning framework. The primary reaction scheme will be supported by a backup electricity market-based mechanism, where distributed synchronous generators will optimally contribute to mitigation of cyberattacks in the regions of the system not fully alleviated by network reconfiguration. Finally, the third objective of this research is to perform hardware-in-the-loop experimental validation of the proposed remedial actions on a lab-scale smart microgrid.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a critical step in machine learning systems, representation learning is meant to be robust in its capacity, regardless of the mutation of raw data due to noises or the variations of raw data caused by capture devices. In the era of big data, representation learning techniques are confronted with new challenges. Massive data collected from different sensors (e.g., the multi-view camera system) or presented in different modalities (e.g., audio-visual-text) have overloaded existing representation learning techniques. In addition, streaming data received from the Internet and sensitive data accumulated over time, such as personal albums and electronic health records, require the established representation learning model to adapt and account for incoming data. This project will develop a robust continual representation learning model to address these challenges. In real-world scenarios where data access is restricted (e.g., sensitive data) or the processing power of devices is limited (e.g., edge and mobile devices), stakeholders will benefit from the adaptive representation learning techniques to enable continual data analyses.<br/><br/>This project seeks to advance the fundamental understanding of continual multi-view robust representation learning by integrating machine intelligence and human knowledge in AI-enabled security contexts. There are three unique contributions. First, the project will investigate multi-view consistency pursuit to fuse knowledge and generate a view-invariant representation robust to domain shifts frequently encountered in real-world data. Second, this research will revisit and explore adversarial learning in multi-view contexts to enable new attack modes, including iterative, cross-view, and induced modes. Generated adversarial samples and training procedures will benefit and empower the acquired multi-view representation learning models to mitigate various forms of artificial noise. Third, new continual learning models will be created through a novel Memory Bounded Search Tree to enable the evolution of multi-view representation learning despite continual streams of data. Furthermore, to reduce the search space and uncertainty related to the data, this research will leverage human knowledge to acquire critical annotations and empirical strategies for the proposed continual learning models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, due to the traditional separation between career trajectories in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and those in the healthcare sector, STEM graduate students often do not have training in a clinical setting. Consequently, many are not aware of the ethical principles, laws, and policies associated with the development and use of technologies in those settings. As a result, advancements and innovations made in the design and manufacturing of biomedical devices in academic institutions often do not appropriately address the application side of the technology. This gap in STEM education can be addressed by developing a convergent research program that weaves different disciplines together. Knowledge of the applied side of medical technology research is necessary for effective and sustainable innovation. This NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) project brings together the awardee institution with the Mayo Clinic in Arizona, to address this gap by creating and fostering a use-inspired, human-centered outlook in STEM graduate students through a set of structured and convergent research and training activities. The project anticipates training 34 Ph.D. students, including 17 funded trainees from engineering, design, manufacturing, and science disciplines. <br/><br/>Trainees will focus on research problems associated with imaging devices and technologies, additively manufactured implants and devices, personable diagnostic devices, tissue repair and regeneration devices, and applications of cybersecurity, data science, and artificial intelligence to medical devices. Trainees will follow a training schedule consisting of NRT core curriculum courses, applied and experiential learning components, including a Mayo Clinic residency, MedTech accelerator participation, a Graduate-Undergraduate Mentorship (GUM) Program, and experiential and professional activities. NRT trainees will learn aspects that are not traditionally part of STEM education, such as limitations and opportunities for technology-human interactions in medical and clinical settings. They will also gain an understanding of ethical principles and develop an entrepreneurial mindset and aptitude. This training experience will enhance students? education by providing breath in the three research thrust areas: (1) Human-technology interface in medical devices, (2) Ethics in research and innovation, (3) Law and policies in research and technology. Cross-disciplinary teams of faculty are selected as the advising team for each NRT trainee; and tudents will integrate at least one of these research thrusts into their specific research topic through their dissertation.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

Examples of these systems include distributed cloud computing and mobile cellular networks. To enhance real-time decision-making, reduce latency, and address growing privacy concerns, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a paradigm for implementing artificial intelligence (AI) models at the edge. FL enables edge devices to collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data. However, the FL framework encounters critical challenges: (1) the varied computational capabilities of edge devices cause inconsistent training convergence and potential latency issues; (2) the diverse data distributions across devices introduce biases, adversely affecting model accuracy; and (3) although raw data is not shared, model updates communicated among edge devices are still vulnerable to privacy breaches. This project aims to develop an innovative privacy-preserving FL framework suitable for heterogeneous edge devices without compromising performance. The anticipated outcomes of this project promise significant societal benefits by enabling new applications in various domains, such as healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity, where data privacy is paramount. Additionally, the investigator is committed to promoting educational diversity and empowering underrepresented groups in science and engineering fields. This commitment extends to fostering a multidisciplinary research environment for college students and broadening the interest of secondary school students in AI-related subjects.<br/><br/>To address the three challenges mentioned, the proposed FL framework is divided into three phases: local training, data transmission, and server-based global model training. (1) During the local training phase, instead of deploying identical models to all edge devices, tailored device-specific models are locally trained. These local models are adaptive to the diverse computational capabilities and data distributions to mitigate biases and enhance model performance. (2) In the data transmission phase, differential privacy technology is utilized to protect data privacy on edge devices to prevent inference attacks. (3) The global training phase leverages the underutilized computational resources of the server, aiming to significantly improve the efficiency and performance of the global model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The scale of these systems and limited defensive resources simply do not allow for complete security coverage at all times. Moreover, adequate security is increasingly reliant on a defender?s informational capabilities. Knowledge about an adversary?s abilities, objectives, and actions are essential pieces of information that can be used to mitigate the harm from potential attacks. This project investigates how the security of these systems can be maximized through the strategic management and control of informational advantages. Key questions to be addressed in this project are: What type of information is most valuable given costs for acquisition? How much more secure does the system become with critical pieces of information? Can obfuscating the system?s capabilities from an adversary render their attacks less effective? The research will develop a theoretical framework on which to address these questions and to inform effective and information-aware security policies that may be applied across domains. In particular, the project is well-positioned to interface with the highly active cybersecurity community in the Colorado Springs area. The research will also be leveraged to enhance curriculum and research opportunities for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project seeks to analyze strategic decision-making in adversarial environments, with an emphasis on the role that informational capabilities play. These scenarios are most readily studied using tools from game theory and optimization. The research will leverage and adapt popular models of competitive resource allocation, known as ?Colonel Blotto? and ?General Lotto? games. The central goal of the project is to incorporate various elements of asymmetric information, and to investigate their impacts on the players? optimal allocation strategies. This enables a principled approach to study the interplay between information and performance, as well as to guide the design of effective information-gathering and manipulation policies. The findings from this project will advance fundamental knowledge along two directions. First, they will provide new analyses regarding the strategic control of information in adversarial settings. Standard game-theoretic analyses primarily consider the informational environment to be static, i.e., unable to be altered through the efforts of the agents that it affects. Second, the project will develop principled approaches for system planners to implement security policies in a variety of environmental and adverse conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Of all the different kinds of exploitable software weaknesses, memory errors -- i.e., bugs that can be (ab)used by attackers, via crafty inputs, to corrupt or leak memory contents -- have been particularly pernicious to deal with. Developers and security engineers are unable to keep up with the sheer number of security errors (e.g., memory errors)  being exploited that need patching.  The focus of this project is on adapting software defenses to the specific deployment environment, as that environment changes due to new functionality and new threats.  The project will produce open source prototypes of tools to automate the adaptation of defenses, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the defenses while radically reducing the human effort involved in defending against new threats as they arise.  The objective is to enable more effective, sophisticated defenses by automating the customization of defenses to fit the deployment environments.   The resulting techniques and tools will contribute to the next-generation security architecture that enables software defenses to be constantly in flux to provide robust software protection mechanisms.  <br/><br/>The project consists of three synergistic thrusts under the umbrella of adaptive security: adaptive hardening, hardware-assisted adaptive protection and adaptive debloating.  The project will investigate techniques to enable software systems to dynamically adapt their defenses and functionality along several dimensions. Techniques for binary rewriting and program hardening will be enhanced to support adaptability.  Adaptive hardening will equip binaries with rich metadata including call graphs and types. Static binary rewriting performs install-time, load-time, and runtime adaptations. Hardware-assisted adaptive hardening uses hardware features such as Intel's CET for adaptive hardening; Finally, unused code is removed by automating debloating. There are several benefits of an adaptive approach to software security. First, the capability to be agile in software hardening creates a diversified and unpredictable environment, which hinders the ability of adversaries to use canned recipes to bypass exploit mitigations. Second, hardening rectification allows software to make the best use of the hardening capabilities that a particular setting offers, while dynamically adapting the deployed defenses to meet changing needs. The outcomes of this research will improve the state-of-the-art in defense against emerging software threats, and alleviate the concerns of the broader security community regarding hurdles (e.g., performance, compatibility) that until now have prevented the deployment of protections with guaranteed security properties. The project will develop and share new knowledge through cybersecurity and computer science curricula, and more broadly thought workshops and seminars for high school students and science educators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such security concerns severely hinder the application of off-the-shelf passive UHF RFID tags to security-sensitive contexts. This project also offers an integrated education platform for curriculum development, graduate student training, undergraduate research engagement, broadening participation of female and underrepresented students in computing, and outreach activities in the IoT and cybersecurity domains. <br/><br/>This project aims to boost the applicability of off-the-shelf passive UHF RFID systems to security-sensitive applications such as user authentication, access control to protected physical or electronic resources, and critical asset tracking. The proposed research comprises five integrated thrusts. Thrust 1 is to develop a novel system to fingerprint RFID tags based on their unique frequency-dependent backscatter-power profiles over a wide frequency band. Thrust 2 is to develop a novel two-factor RFID authentication system based on the user's rhythmic taps on the RFID tag. Thrust 3 is to develop a smartwatch-aided two-factor RFID authentication system based on the anticipated strong correlation between the smartwatch and RFID data. Thrust 4 is to develop a smartwatch-aided continuous authentication system to verify a user's continuous physical presence in a protected area.

They are increasingly used nowadays, including IoT (Internet of Things) devices (e.g., smart home devices) and embedded devices (e.g., Bluetooth/Wi-Fi modules in the desktop/mobile platform). However, the advantage comes with the expense of no or limited software and hardware protections. As a result, new vulnerabilities are being discovered in resource-constrained systems. To mitigate this problem, Rust is gaining popularity in implementing these systems due to its safety and close performance to C/C++, while a Rust compiler enforces restrictive rules and leverages the unsafe keyword to bypass them. Unfortunately, the introduction of unsafe Rust code also introduces potential safety issues defeating the purpose of using Rust to enhance resource-constrained systems. This project addresses this challenge by exploring, designing and experimenting with various tools and frameworks in the context of resource-constrained systems, and provides insights on unsafe Rust code in these systems. In this way, this project targets reducing the negative effect of using the unsafe keyword and support developers with more confidence in safety guarantee. <br/><br/>This project aims to improve using Rust in resource-constrained systems by eliminating unnecessary usage of the unsafe keyword or preventing the potential issues caused by unsafe Rust code. As a result, resource-constrained systems written in Rust would be more secure, even if the unsafe keyword is used. Furthermore, tools and frameworks developed in this project will be open-source. They will not only be helpful to resource-constrained system developers, but also contribute to the Rust community. The best practices concluded and lessons learned during this project will also be open to the community. The goal is to elaborate the result as RFC (Request for Comments) documents and make them the standard.

However, human-AI collaborative decision-making performance is often lower than expected. A lack of sufficient and effective engagement between the person and the AI is a fundamental contributor to these disappointing outcomes. Often, decision makers do not engage with the advice provided by the AI system with their full cognitive capacity or, when they do, they engage with it in ways that lead to inappropriate trust and reliance on the system---both under-reliance and over-reliance are a problem. In current practice, AI-based decision aids do not sufficiently encourage human engagement, nor do they take human engagement behaviors into account. This project aims to create radical new designs for human-AI interaction in which AI is engagement-oriented to improve human-AI collaborations in decision-making.<br/><br/>This project develops and evaluates three novel human-AI interaction paradigms: (1) Human-Reflective AI interaction, in which AI is designed to increase the decision makers' engagement level by guiding them to critically reflect on the decision process; (2) Human-Adaptive AI interaction, in which AI assistance will be presented in a personalized manner to nudge decision-makers into appropriately engaging with the AI recommendations; and (3) Human-Behavior-aware AI interaction, in which AI is trained to anticipate decision-makers' engagement behavior and optimize for the human-AI team performance. This project will contribute new scientific knowledge about ways to incorporate cognitive factors of decision-makers, including their capabilities and limitations, into the designs of AI-based decision aids to best support decision-makers and increase AI-human team performance. Comprehensive evaluations on the impacts of new human-AI interaction paradigms on usability, user experience, and the human-AI decision-making performance will reveal the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches and inform the selection among them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
